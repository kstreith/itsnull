        <h3>How to satisfy customer requirements?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The great question, is there an answer?</li>
          <li>Yeah, know what you don't know. Be agile.</li>
          <li>Deliver early, deliver often.</li>
          <li>Get feedback early, get feedback often.</li>
          <li>Reprioritize as needed.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Automate it. No, really automate it.</li>
          <li>Continuous integration - automated builds on check-in.</li>
          <li>Continous deploy - automated or push button deployments all the way to production</li>

        <h3>How to make code easy to change</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be able to assert code behaves the same before and after a change</li>
          <li>Code is maintainable</li>
          <li>Code is readable</li>
        </ul>
      </section>      
      <section>
        <h3>How to assert behavior hasn't changed?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write tests</li>
          <li>Unit tests, integration tests, system tests, etc.</li>
          <li>Make them easy to run</li>
          <li>Automate them, e.g. continuous integration, continuous deploy</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>How to ensure maintainability?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Afraid to change it? Then it's not maintainable</li>
          <li>Can't explain it? Then it's not maintainable</li>
          <li>Can't easily debug it? Then it's not maintainable</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Unit tests can help with maintainability</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Changing it? Tests help prevent regressions</li>
          <li>Explain it? Tests provide example of happy paths and sad paths</li>
          <li>Debug it? Debug the test to get directly to a piece of lower level code</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>However, tests aren't the whole answer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tests only assist with their focus area</li>
          <li>To improve maintainability, we need to improve readability</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What does readable code mean?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can code be universally readable?</li>
          <li>Are all books universally readable?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What does readable code mean? (pt. 2)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Chemistry Book</li>
          <li>Knitting Book</li>
          <li>Economics Book</li>
          <li>Software Design Pattern Book</li>
          <li>Are all of those equally readable for everyone?</li>
          <li>No, they have required knowledge of the domain that contributes to the readability</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What does readable code mean? (pt. 3)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We write custom software to deliver value for a domain</li>
          <li>So each piece of software has required domain knowledge</li>
          <li>So, readability of code isn't universal</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What does readable code mean? (pt. 4)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You need someone with domain knowledge first</li>
          <li>Then you can evaluate readability</li>
          <li>So, to improve readability, you need another team member to read it.</li>
          <li>So... Code Reviews are paramount</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What are Code Reviews?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Another member of the team reads the code and provides feedback</li>
          <li>That feedback is incorporated back into the code</li>
          <li>Repeat until team is satisifed</li>
          <li>Think back to editing a writing assignment</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Why do Code Reviews?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase readability</li>
          <li>Keep scary code out</li>
          <li>Keep code that can't be explained out</li>
          <li>Keep code that can't be debugged out</li>
          <li>... Improve Code Quality</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Why do Code Reviews? (pt. 2)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Other Benefits as well</li>
          <li>Find bugs earlier</li>
          <li>Intrinsic cross training</li>
          <li>Break down of silos</li>
          <li>Mentor/on board team members</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What isn't a code review</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not a performance or review metric for software engineers</li>
          <li>Not a way to belittle others</li>
          <li>Not a way to settle scores</li>
          <li>Not a way to rubber stamp each others work</li>
          <li>Not just the job of one person on the team</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Mindset of the coder</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Review comments are an opening line in a discussion</li>
          <li>Review comments can be ignored</li>
          <li>Review comments are NOT an order or directive to be blindly followed</li>
          <li>You still own the completion of the task/feature, not the reviewer</li>
          <li>Remember, the quantity of feedback has NOTHING to do with the size of your change</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Mindset of the reviewer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You are providing feedback, not orders or directives</li>
          <li>Not all of your feedback may be accepted or acted upon</li>
          <li>Never a need for personal attacks or inappropriate language, it distracts from your point and wastes time</li>
          <li>Try not to pre-filter your feedback, if you think of it, put it down</li>
          <li>Try and review equally, regardless if you are reviewing team lead's code or new team member's code</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Mindset of the team</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember, the goal is to improve code quality</li>
          <li>Don't let reviews get bogged down in minutiae, e.g. formatting arguments</li>
          <li>Don't let reviews become repetitive</li>
          <li>Use tools and standards to automate formatting and repetitive things so they are fixed before the review ever starts</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <!--
        Early problems when starting reviews:
          - It will devolve into arguments about things that you likely don't have:
              - Preferred Formatting Standards
              - Preferred Naming Conventions
              - Standard Patterns
              - Architectural Patterns
              - Preferred Error Handling Strategies 
          - Progress will appear slow and always contentious
          - But you are converging your code so it appears to be written by one author, not N authors.
          - That will increase readability in the long term, a single file or feature no longer randomly switches between N writing styles.
      -->
      <!-- 
        Resolving disputes
          - Try and let coder and reviewer work it out
          - Bring members of the team into the discussion, come to consensus
          - Last resort is decision from on high
      -->
      <!--
        - What are we looking for?
          - Code that you can't read
          - Code that you can't understand
              - What it does?
              - Why it does what it does?
          - Code you wouldn't know how to debug
          - Code you would be afraid to start maintaining tomorrow
        - What are we reviewing?
          - Changes in the commit
          - Changes NOT in the commit, should other changes have been made, but weren't?
        - Does this implement the task or user story?
        - Does it actually run? Do you know how to run it or test it?
        - Have you tried to break it?
        - Does it handle errors or invalid input?
        - Does it have any performance issues?
        - Does it have any security issues?
        - Is it standards compliant?
        - Does the team want to bring in a new 3rd party dependency? Or write this code custom?
        - Could this be simplified?
        - Does the code follow the patterns for this team?
        - Does the code use clear names?
        - Does it have unit tests? Have you reviewed the unit tests as well?
        - Should other code be changed as a result of this? Or removed as a result of this?
      -->
      <!--
        Misc.
          - Try to limit scope creep within a single code review, e.g. now the commit morphs into something else.            
          - Don't use the above as an excuse not to do something
          - Feel free to start the review even earlier, e.g. engage other members of the team earlier.
          - Review before the code is committed to master or trunk
             - Once code is committed to master or trunk, excuses about breaking working code start piling up.
             - you end up with a list of feedback but no actual actions taken based upon that feedback.
          - Should every commit be reviewed?
            - Yes, I think so.
            - Any attempt to create a different rule results in loop holes that will be used by devs on team in a hurry.
          - How many reviewers, which reviewers?
            - At least one reviewer, more is fine as well. How critical is that code?
            - Whatever works for you team.
            - I've seen self assignment work.
            - I've seen team lead assignment work.
            - Just ensure you are getting value from your reviews
            - Don't have reviewers only/coders only. That demotivates people, creates adversial relationships.
          - Do you create a review checklist?
            - Sure, if it helps. Make sure it helps add value to your reviews.
          - Do you write a standards document?
            - Sure, if it helps. Make sure it helps add value to your reviews.
          - Reviews take too long?
            - How many review cycles are too many?
              - I've been involved in reviews that went through 20+ rounds. But we were still getting value.
            - Do they? Are you still getting value?
          - Leave it better than you found it.
            - You don't have to get it all in the first pass. 
            - You don't have to get it all in this review, maybe the next review as well.
          - You might get a comment on code you didn't touch, so what? The goal is to improve the code quality.
          - Don't take feedback personally.
            - You got paid for the code you wrote that went into the review.
            - If it makes sense, delete it as a result of the review.
            - No one expects you to know all the standards etc.
          - It should almost always be possible to provide one piece of feedback, NO ONE is perfect.
            - Yes, even on a one line code change. Especially on a one line code change.
