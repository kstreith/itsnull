Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="A"><div>A</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137336/archer-danger-zone-board-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Archer: Danger Zone</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 4.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Channeling the action, adventure and danger that comes with everyday life in the Archer animated series, Archer: The Danger Zone! Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &quot;come on&quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.&#10;&#10;The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &quot;Office Map&quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Arkham Horror</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Role Playing, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> &#10; The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties.

Will they Prevail? &#10;&#10;&#10;Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town.

Progress during &quot;The War to End All Wars&quot; was measured by yards, not miles. The Italians were on the side of the Allies, while Turkey &ndash; then at the center of the Ottoman Empire &ndash; was one of the members of what was known as the Central Powers. Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the two other main Central Powers.&#10;&#10;The major Allies, sometimes referred to as the Entente, consisted of the British Empire, France, Italy, the United States, and Imperial Russia. The alliance included other historical members, but they more or less fell under the command and control of one of these great powers. In fact, had General Pershing not insisted that its integrity be maintained, even the American army would have found itself as simply being replacements for French and British.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies: WWI 1914 puts players in charge of one of the major powers, each with its own infantry sculpt; other sculpts represent the artillery, tanks, aircraft, and naval line-up of either the Allies or the Central Powers.&#10;&#10;As designer Larry Harris notes, &quot;While playing this game, you will quickly realize that this is not World War II. There are no massive sweeps across continents with blitzing armored divisions and aircraft. Instead, there are a series of determined offensives resisted by equally determined armies dedicated to holding the line. You will find that your depleting resources of men and artillery must be deployed with great thought and efficiency. You will be fighting pretty much the way man has been fighting with each other for thousands of years &ndash; only this time the ability to kill your enemy, and for him to kill you, has become intolerably efficient.&quot;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="B"><div>B</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Bang!

Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It's an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&#10;&#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first?

Disguised by a secret identity, they try to kidnap the Elder of the opposing clan or give their lives for the benefit of their own Elder. Malicious attacks, aimed indiscretions, and assistance from others will slowly uncover the truth: Who fights for whom? And who is the Elder?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player knows three things:&#10;&#10;&#10; Who he is and to which clan he belongs&#10; That a few other players are his allies, while everyone else is the enemy of both him and his clan&#10; The clan to which one of his neighbors belongs &ndash; although some characters can lie about their clan identity&#10;&#10;&#10;Now the players have to figure out who the Elder of the opposing team is (if there is one) and capture him. To do this, players need to attack, negotiate and deduce, with an attacked player being required to reveal information, such as his rank or clan affiliation. Each player has an ability unique to his character, and this ability can be used only at the moment that he reveals his rank. The Assassin forces players to suffer wounds, for example, while the Guardian protects a player of the character's choice.&#10;&#10;In the end, if you capture your rival clan's Elder, you win &ndash; but if you capture the wrong vampire, you've fallen into the enemy's trap and lose the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173441/bring-your-own-book" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Bring Your Own Book</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.35</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your old favorite book is now your new favorite game!

How quickly can you find &ldquo;lyrics from a country western song&rdquo; in your dog-training guide? What kind of &ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?&#10;&#10;In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&#10;&#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/114438/wait-theres-more" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>But Wait, There&#39;s More!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.08</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Have you ever wanted a glass, that stops messy accidents before they happen, or pants, that provide relief at the touch of a button?

The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a &quot;Bang!&quot; or a &quot;Click! Click!&quot; card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.&#10;&#10;Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a &quot;Bang!&quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot.

Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected.

They each act as a member of a secret association, but no one knows who is friend and who is foe.&#10;&#10;Each player starts in one of two secret associations. He also gets a secret profession with a special ability. So at the beginning of the game you have no information about the membership and the professions of the others. To win the game, each association has to collect 3 defined artifacts jointly. Therefore you have to find out who your allies are and where to find the artifacts among the other secret objects that are in possession of other players. You can get this information during the game either by trading objects with other players, because every object has a special ability, e.g. &quot;Trade it in and you may take a look at your trading partners-association.&quot; or by struggling with other players, because the winner of a struggle can view the cards of the underdog and steal one of them. But be careful, all players can support the attacker OR defender in a struggle. If they know about your identity but you don't know theirs it may be risky to struggle.&#10;&#10;Turn actions, one of:&#10;Trade&#10;Duel&#10;Spy - Choose another player and draw one random object card from her/his hand.

Players must declare for one or the other and abstentions are not allowed.&#10;&#10;Victory: Declare Victory by naming your team and who has the three items, starting with yourself, then one by one. If you name players on your team incorrectly or they don't have the object(s) you lose. You can also declare victory by announcing the opposing team and the members of that team holding their objects by naming them, as firstly part of the team, and secondly that they have a relevant object.

At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&#10;&#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&#10;&#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146021/eldritch-horror" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Eldritch Horror</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="F"><div>F</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169124/flick-em" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Flick &#39;em Up!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.36</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, American West</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> The cities in the West are not the safest place to be.

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round. The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10; Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10; Pyramid Card &#10; Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10; Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="I"><div>I</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37759/incan-gold" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Incan Gold</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2006</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Bluffing, Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.

However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&#10;&#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&#10;&#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&#10;&#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Pit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.42</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1903</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Economic, Farming, Party Game, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> The original game was invented by Harry E.

In this loud, real-time trading game, players are given the task of cornering the market in one type of commodity. There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round. When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves. If you're successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, &quot;Corner on wheat!&quot; (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others.

One image will be leftover as the outcast.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished, you compare your pairs with those of other players.

Each player gets a number of tokens, which act as victory points (see further below). &#10;The rest of the players now place their figures, which are attached to little ropes, onto the playing mat in the middle of the play area.

Also, if the die roller doesn't act fast enough to cover all figures who needed to be trapped in the cup on the roll of 1 or 6, he has to pay 1 token to each other player and pass the die cup to the next player, who the acts as the die roller until he misses to cover a figure, and so on.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined when one player has reached a set amount of tokens, or one player has lost all tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, especially for young children, there are also colour-coded dice included, and instead of 1 or 6, two colours are determined when the game begins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="R"><div>R</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Resistance</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 5 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Science Fiction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Simultaneous Action Selection, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!&#10;&#10;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;Rule Correction:&#10;&#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Resistance: Avalon</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 5 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval, Negotiation, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Memory, Partnerships, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization.

Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180198/rolling-america" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Rolling America</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Number, Puzzle</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &quot;guard&quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &quot;dupe&quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on their map wins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="S"><div>S</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Saboteur</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Exploration, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Route/Network Building, Take That</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175549/salem" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Salem</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 12</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 25 - 35</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Accuse and defend your fellow townsfolk as you hunt down the witches of Salem. Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.&#10;&#10;The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.&#10;&#10;Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.&#10;&#10;Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;&#10;&#10;During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.&#10;&#10;Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.&#10;&#10;As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate, the Constable chooses someone to potentially save, and the Spy chooses a Tryal card to look at. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.&#10;&#10;Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33604/say-anything" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Say Anything</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.89</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think.

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&#10;&#10;All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.&#10;&#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&#10;&#10;You are a Sheep.&#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;&#10;&#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&#10;&#10;&#10; Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&#10; Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&#10; Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&#10;&#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&#10;&#10;&#10; If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&#10; If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&#10;&#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173291/spit-it-out" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Spit It Out</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.51</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Think fast!

Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!&#10;&#10;At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points. However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.&#10;&#10;After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137550/story-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Story War</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Mythology, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> It&rsquo;s a card game for 3-to-8 players that combines storytelling and combat!

Using your own 1:64 scale die-cast cars, race opponents along rally themed card tracks that you create. The cards are expandable so you can challenge unlimited players and build courses as simple or as big as you can imagine.&#10;&#10;On your turn, flip one track card over, and follow the signs as you race through jumps and obstacles toward the finish line&mdash;all while fending off attacks from your opponents. The first player to reach the winner's circle wins one of five trophies&mdash;and an advantage in the next race!&#10;&#10;But don't think for a second that getting to the Winner's Circle is easy. With over 30 RPM (Radical Performance Maneuvers) cards that allow players to boost ahead, burst through obstacles or sabotage opponents, THUNDER TRACK shifts racing strategy into high gear. Whether it's smokescreens and straightaways or pit stops and pace notes, the right RPM combo at the right time will keep your foot on the gas and your opponents off-track.&#10;&#10;If tire spikes and land mines can&rsquo;t seem to keep your fellow racers from taking the top spot in the winner&rsquo;s circle, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re also introducing 10 different weapons to choose from. Send your opponents skidding off track with a missile attack or drag them into the dirt and leave them stranded with a well-aimed grappling hook. But, whichever weapon you choose, you&rsquo;ll have access to unique special abilities and features sure to keep your opponents eating your dust.&#10;&#10;Think you've got what it takes to be a Turbo Rally Card Racing Champion? Only the toughest will survive the new THUNDER TRACK...&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Tichu</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1991</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Hand Management, Partnerships, Trick-taking</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tichu is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only her first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154498/till-dawn" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Till Dawn</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Horror</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Don't get caught in the sun!&#10;&#10; Till Dawn, a 20&ndash;30-minute game for 4-8 vampires (or 12, with the expansion), takes place over the course of three nights during which time all self respecting vampires leave their coffins to hunt. A deck of hunt cards is passed from vampire to vampire, each taking one card, reading it aloud, then passing the rest on. If a feeding card is drawn, all vampires gain blood tokens &mdash; but the deck is also loaded with events, vampire slayers, a vicious werewolf, invitations from the elders, and the creeping threat of sunrise.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124172/tsuro-seas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Tsuro of the Seas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Route/Network Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &mdash; that is, keep on the game board &mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/134352/two-rooms-and-boom" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Two Rooms and a Boom</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 6 - 30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Two Rooms and a Boom &ndash; a social deduction/hidden role party game for six or more players &ndash; there are two teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.

There is also a Moderator who controls the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves.

Unable to determine who amongst themselves are werewolves, they've called in a group of master inquisitors to help sort out this mess before it's too late. That's where you and your team come in. No stranger to werewolf infestations, you know that the best thing to do is to start lynching suspects.&#10;&#10;You no sooner get started on this project when you discover that there's a problem &ndash; Werewolves have also infiltrated your team of inquisitors! Now you're in a serious pickle: You need to save the village while thwarting the werewolves whom are working alongside you...&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition is a standalone game of deduction, secrets and betrayal with no elimination. Part of the fun is figuring out who the werewolves are on your team, but even then, you've still got to outsmart them!&#10;&#10;More specifically, the humans need to rid the town of werewolves in order to win, while the werewolf players need to eliminate human villagers so that the werewolves can overrun the town. To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident &ndash; but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round. Who will live? Who will die?

Don't get shotgunned.&#10;&#10;In Zombie Dice, you are a zombie. You want braaains &ndash; more brains than any of your zombie buddies. The 13 custom dice are your victims. Push your luck to eat their brains, but stop rolling before the shotgun blasts end your turn! Whoever collects 13 brains first wins. Each game takes 10 to 20 minutes and can be taught in a single round.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you take three dice from the box and roll them. A brain symbol is worth one point at the end of the round, while footsteps allow you to reroll this particular dice. Shotgun blasts on the other hand are rather bad, cause if you collect three shotgun blasts during your turn, it is over for you and you get no points. After rolling three dice, you may decide if you want to score your current brain collection or if you want to push your luck by grabbing new dice so you have three again and roll once more.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
