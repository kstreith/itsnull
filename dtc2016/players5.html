One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has &#39;no chance&#39; element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham&#39;s 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, &#39;robber baron&#39; oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham&#39;s original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world&#39;s best railroad game developers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/423/1856" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">1856</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1995</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 300 - 300</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Route/Network Building, Stock Holding, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham&#39;s 1829, and adds several new elements.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that&#39;s below the card&#39;s number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">7 Wonders</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Civilization</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you&#39;ll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you&#39;ve already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&amp;ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="A"><div>A</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141517/study-emerald" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">A Study in Emerald</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.31</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy, Horror, Murder/Mystery, Novel-based, Political, Spies/Secret Agents, Zombies</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management, Partnerships, Point to Point Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> A Study in Emerald is a game for two to five players based on the award-winning short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman. In this stylistic mash-up of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft, the worst has already happened and the world is now ruled by the Old Ones. However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &amp;ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &amp;ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163930/abracawhat" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Abracada…What?</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.68</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Memory</div><div><b>Description:</b> Abraca...what? is a family game of deduction and spellcasting.

You typically must defeat at least two in order to face the Guardian of the Treasure Horde, the ultimate Encounter! Each time an Encounter is defeated* you level up, gaining the ability to use more powerful Treasures, such as items which heal and grant special abilities, and equipment and weapons that boost your abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Adventure IN is two games in one! The base game is a quick, competitive Tournament through a randomly selected Dungeon. The first Adventurer, or Adventurers, to reach and defeat the Dungeon Guardian will be victorious. You may choose to cooperate at strategic points in the game, especially at the final Encounter where you may have to choose between winning with a friend or losing to your opponents. To add variety, Adventure IN also includes a fully cooperative Campaign. In the Campaign, you and the other players work together to try and beat a series of Dungeons. Each Dungeon has a unique layout, usually requiring that you defeat several Encounters before facing the Dungeon Guardian.

For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&amp;#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you&#39;ll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&amp;#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it&#39;s important to do some things with high preference.&amp;#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it&#39;s a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents&#39; actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90419/airlines-europe" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Airlines Europe</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.38</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 75 - 75</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Route/Network Building, Set Collection, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> Before Ticket to Ride, before Santa Fe Rails, before Union Pacific &amp;ndash; yet after Acquire &amp;ndash; there was Airlines, one of the earliest published games from designer Alan R.

On a player&#39;s turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank.

His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &amp;quot;One Thousand and One Nights&amp;quot; collection of folk stories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &amp;ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &amp;ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players&#39;s influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &amp;ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &amp;ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/492/aladdins-dragons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Aladdin&#39;s Dragons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.94</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Arabian, Bluffing, Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Set Collection, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> After the immediate response to Richard Breese&#39;s Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&amp;#195;&amp;#188;ck Verlags-GmbH contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill. Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency. Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; currency. With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market. The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies. On a player&#39;s turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player&#39;s Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players&#39; longest external &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; section within their complex.

The primary module is &amp;quot;The Vizier&#39;s Favor&amp;quot;, which allows players to buy a building out of turn but has to be paid with exact amount.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. &amp;quot;The Builders Huts&amp;quot; (Die Bauh&amp;uuml;tte) introduces a number of new tiles that only count in the scoring when other tiles of the same color are built next to them. Hut tiles are free, but their number is limited to three per player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. With the &amp;quot;The Currency Exchange&amp;quot; (Wechselstube), players can buy building tiles by mixing different currencies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. The fourth module is a set of bonus cards that are dealt to the players. Each of the tiles shows a particular building. If the matching building is part of your Alhambra, then the bonus card can be revealed and will count as another building of that category.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About Granada, also called as Alhambra Advanced: it is a standalone game the players develop the city of Granada next to Sierra Nevada, where the famous Alhambra stands, by buying building tiles to construct the city which will earn the most victory points.

The game goes over five rounds giving a scoring after the 1st, 3rd and 5th round. Victory points are awarded for majorities of allocated buildings (very similar to the original game Alhambra). To get the buildings you roll 8 dice each showing the six building-symbols. Each player has 3 rolls on his turn to get as many similar symbols as possible (up to a max of 8). A player can only note his result for one type of building. The results of the dice rolls from every player is marked on the game board. So everybody can compare his dice rolls with those of the other players. After a round is completed the player with the highest dice-roll can choose between 2 buildings of the respective category or 1 building and a special counter giving a certain bonus. (Bonuses can be: additional 1-3 VPs, extra dice-roll, exchange one building, determine Starting player, etc.) The second best player in that category will get the other part. Each round has a certain number of turns depending on how many players are playing (3, 4 or 5 turns). So, because a player can only hit one type of building during his turn, he cannot score all 6 types of buildings in a single round. After round #1, #3 and #5 the majority in each building category is awarded the same way like in Alhambra. The player with the most VP&#39;s wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special: There is a variant in which you can combine the building counters of the Alhambra game which adds some building strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Integrates with:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Alhambra&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72204/alien-uprising" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Alien Uprising</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.41</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tensions have been high with the alien &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; races of the galaxy &amp;ndash; the Zothren &amp;ndash; and your ship has crash landed on the planet Hive IV, one of the more renegade &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; planets.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&amp;rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&amp;rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&amp;rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed.

The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play. Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn. A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby. There are also coin options that allow a player to do a range of things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aquaretto can be played as a stand alone game or used in conjunction with Zooloretto for a mega-game of sorts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It should be noted that Aquaretto is a slightly more involved experience than Zooloretto, with some more involved options, such as scoring bonuses for acquiring workers that interact with how many fish symbols a player has in their water park.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/814/aquarius" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Aquarius</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1998</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Religious</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The groovy card game that&#39;s kind of like dominoes (only better!)

Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &amp;quot;come on&amp;quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character&#39;s own ego. Naturally you&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &amp;quot;Office Map&amp;quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location.

The proposal will affect five issues &amp;ndash; military, currency, etc. &amp;ndash; in various ways, and each player has a secret document for the round that tells him how a change in each issue will affect him.

Some cards produce resources or transform one type of resources into another and award victory points, while others let you perform actions. Carefully planning the chain of cards that you will play during the game turn is the key to success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Artificium lasts four turns. At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players&#39; individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player&#39;s coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins). The player with the most victory points is considered to be the wisest medieval ruler and is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/827/attila" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Attila</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.53</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> In 375 A.D., Attila&#39;s mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of &#39;your&#39; tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don&#39;t have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129946/attraction" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Attraction</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> The reactive interplay between the magnets in AttrAction is what gives this game its spark!

Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It&#39;s an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else&#39;s) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who&#39;ll get his shot off first? Play continues until one team meets its winning condition &amp;ndash; and death won&#39;t necessarily keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177048/barking-wrong-tree" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Barking Up the Wrong Tree</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.02</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Barking Up The Wrong Tree, players must try to collect the most trees, preferably of different types.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&amp;hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don&#39;t match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Official Site, Rules &amp;amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;amp;esem=4&amp;#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191624/bear-valley" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bear Valley</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.16</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> In Bear Valley, you must be the first to survive the treacherous wilderness and escape to the safety of the camp at the end of the valley.

All those pirates you loved - Black Bart Roberts, Long Ben Avery, Ned Lowe, L&#39;Ollonais, and, of course, Edward Teach (Blackbeard) - 23 in all, are still there, as are the King&#39;s Commissioners sent out to stop them. However, the entire play system has been overhauled, and the result is a game that highlights and specializes in player interaction, with almost no down time for any players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players represent individual pirates, using them to gain Victory Points by amassing booty and, even more importantly, earning Notoriety for their dastardly deeds. Seizing merchants with cargo ranging from useless paper to the monumental treasure of the Mughal emperors, attacking and sacking ports, fighting storms and scurvy, seeking safe haven in infamous pirate ports such as Tortuga and Madagascar, and, hopefully, using Letters of Marque to retire successfully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And while the player is doing this, all of the other players, at the same time, are playing their cards and seizing opportunities to stop the pirates. There is a constant interplay among players, and you never know what is going to happen when you set out to do something.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We&#39;ve simplified movement (no more hexes) and ship battles, we&#39;ve expanded the use of Royal Navy warships, we&#39;ve even added individual hostages!

To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making. One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.

This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142267/bomb-squad" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bomb Squad</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.86</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Print &amp; Play, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Co-operative Play, Hand Management, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> The sergeant hangs the phone up. &amp;quot;Multiple hostages, numerous bombs. We&#39;re up.&amp;quot; We grab our gear, prep the robot and load the van. It&#39;s go time...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An unknown terrorist organization is on the rise, looking to spread fear while profiting from the chaos they release. You, your fellow members of the Retro City Bomb Squad, and your trusty Bomb Squad Robot are the only barriers in the way between those dastardly villains and the innocent civilians of Retro City. Lives are at stake &amp;mdash; and time is ticking &amp;mdash; so let&#39;s go!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bomb Squad is a cooperative game in which 2-6 players are members of a team operating a disposal robot with the mission to disarm bombs and save hostages. The players work together, racing against the clock to provide the appropriate instructions for the robot to achieve their mission objectives. Bomb Squad features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Real-time play: Players each take a turn in clockwise order and are free to take as long as they want on their turn. However, there is a timer counting down in real time until the bombs will detonate, so players will want to be as efficient as possible. &amp;#10; Hidden Card Information: Players hold their cards so that the fronts are facing the other players, which requires that players give each other Intel to figure out which cards they have in hand. &amp;#10; Limited Communication: While players have their cards up and visible to each other, players are allowed to communicate only via the Intel they give each other, which provides hints about the cards they have in their hands. Table talk about which cards are needed, or where the robot should go, gives implied hints about which cards to play and is prohibited.&amp;#10; Co-operative game play: The players all work together, winning or losing collectively as a team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166202/bomb-squad-academy" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bomb Squad Academy</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.74</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Press Your Luck, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> This is the final field exam of your bomb disposal training course. The instructor has rigged three training bombs for you and your team to defuse, but little do you know that there is no way to actually defuse them! The bombs will explode eventually, and if you want to graduate at the top of the class then you&amp;rsquo;ll want to cut high-value wires without triggering the explosives! Grab your wire cutters and steady that shaky hand, because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be an explosive night!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Bomb Squad Academy there are four decks of cards representing the four &amp;ldquo;wires&amp;rdquo; of the bomb, and a trigger track next to each deck. Every round, each player secretly decides (then simultaneously reveals) the wire that they will cut this round (or perhaps they&amp;rsquo;ll chicken out, or even call &amp;ldquo;Wait!&amp;rdquo; preventing a wire from being cut). After actions are revealed, the chosen wires are &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; by flipping cards from those decks. When a card is flipped, its value dictates how far the trigger moves down the trigger track and how many points are earned; cutting wires alone is worth a lot more than cutting the same wire as other players. Push the triggers too far and the bomb will explode! Whoever causes the bomb to explode loses points. Players earn useful Tools during the game that they can use to break the rules. Get through three gruelling bombs with the cleverest cuts to finish your final exam with the most points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173648/booty" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Booty</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.19</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Pirates</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Treasures of all types &amp;mdash; yet the hard part is not capturing the ship&#39;s bounty, but dividing it fairly among the pirates!

What kind of &amp;ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&amp;rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &amp;quot;I&#39;ve got it&amp;quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &amp;quot;I&#39;ve got it&amp;quot;), each Seeker reads what they&#39;ve found.

After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game.

Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they&#39;ve placed their workers next to on the action board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they&#39;ve completed their work, and their money on hand.

Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment.

The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &amp;mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In CO&amp;#226;&amp;#130;&amp;#130;, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you&#39;ve built, UN Goals you&#39;ve completed, Company Goals you&#39;ve met, and Expertise you&#39;ve gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company&#39;s reputation &amp;ndash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/58602/cable-car" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Cable Car San Francisco</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.67</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Route/Network Building, Stock Holding, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Cable Car is a reworked rerelease of the the game originally published in 1997 by db-Spiele as Iron Horse and in 2000 by Queen Games as Metro, with a different theme, new artwork and the components and rules to play the new, optional variant &amp;quot;Cable Car Company,&amp;quot; which introduces stock holding to the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players place square tiles onto the board to form rail lines.

Problematically, several captains often show up for the same adventure. So how shall we figure out who gets what loot? We&amp;rsquo;ll gamble for it of course. That&amp;rsquo;s the pirate way!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Captains Wager is a betting and hand management game which combines classic elements of poker with the kind of clever card play gamers expect from more modern card games. It accommodates 2-5 players and plays for about 30 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each round of the game players receive a hand of 4 crew cards (with values from 1-20) which they play in an attempt to win encounters by committing the highest valued card. The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter. Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning. For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand. Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game. The airship pirate who has claimed the most gold at the end of the game receives the title of Pirate Admiral and declares victory over the competition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131449/captains-industry" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Captains of Industry</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.26</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Industry / Manufacturing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Commodity Speculation</div><div><b>Description:</b> As a captain of industry in the suitably titled game Captains of Industry, you will vie for domination in the cutthroat arena of the marketplace.

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It&#39;s up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies.

The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175117/celestia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Celestia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Aviation / Flight, Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Celestia, a revamped version of Cloud 9, you board an aircraft with a team of adventurers to perform many trips through the cities of Celestia and recover their wonderful treasures.

At the beginning of each round, one player is chosen to be the captain of the trip and he rolls 2-4 dice to discover the challenges that they will face: fog, lightning bolts, killer birds, or pirates. He must then play the appropriate cards &amp;mdash; a compass, a lightning arrester, a foghorn, or even cannons &amp;mdash; to continue on the journey and reach the next city.

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns as follows:&amp;#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Make &amp;quot;variable&amp;quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &amp;quot;uninvited&amp;quot; people in a player&#39;s room, he or she may also roll to &amp;quot;get rid of&amp;quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-If any of the player&#39;s in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &amp;quot;uninvited&amp;quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player&#39;s room. (See above for &amp;quot;getting rid of&amp;quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don&#39;t require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &amp;quot;called&amp;quot;) can also be played in this round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-For each unit of free time the player&#39;s Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &amp;quot;Whenever&amp;quot; cards which can be played at any time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player&#39;s Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player&#39;s total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31730/chicago-express" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Chicago Express</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Route/Network Building, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> Harry Wu&#39;s Chicago Express is an innovative new boardgame with no luck factor.

Smaller, more aggressive railroads like the Wabash spring up to further expand America&#39;s extensive railroads. The sharpest railroad executives vie for the maximum return on their investment in this business game lasting about one hour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A session of Chicago Express is played over a maximum of 8 rounds.

Produce carts are commonly found in each village marketplace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Cinque Terre, a game of strategy, players compete to sell the most valuable produce in the five villages. Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Game Set Up and Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&amp;#10; Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&amp;#10; Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&amp;#10; Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/478/citadels" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Citadels</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.17</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, City Building, Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings.

At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points.

A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you&#39;re collecting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &amp;plusmn;1 point, the second card is &amp;plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nordic version include extensions: &#39;Coloretto: The Extra Cards&#39;, &#39;Coloretto: The Limit Cards&#39; and &#39;Coloretto for two players&#39;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27746/colosseum" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Colosseum</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.19</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Dice Rolling, Roll / Spin and Move, Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Colosseum each player is a Roman impresario - producing great spectacles in his or her arena in the hopes of attracting the most spectators.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company&#39;s weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Phase 1: Schemin&#39; Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&amp;#10; Phase 2: Stealin&#39; The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player&#39;s best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they&#39;ll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; card when you&#39;re in a train car that holds one of these items &amp;mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you&#39;ll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he&#39;s collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player&#39;s character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you&#39;re running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent&#39;s deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he&#39;ll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147151/concept" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Concept</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 12</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Concept, your goal is to guess words through the association of icons.

With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor &amp;mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&amp;#10; They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent&#39;s moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98351/core-worlds" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Core Worlds</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.29</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Civilization, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Introduction&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ancient Galactic Realm, ruled from the Core Worlds of the galaxy, is waning. Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.&amp;#10; Object of the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner!&amp;#10; Game Terms and Game Play Mechanisms&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players. The following are the central concepts of Core Worlds:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Central Zone: Throughout the game, new cards are drawn from the five Galactic Decks and placed face up in the Central Zone, the game&#39;s common play area. These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player&#39;s Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World&#39;s Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World&#39;s Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Warzone: Each player&#39;s Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39463/cosmic-encounter" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Cosmic Encounter</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.61</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Negotiation, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Take That, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the Manufacturer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Build a galactic empire...

Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock. This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player&#39;s turn, he or she becomes the offense. The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet. The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials. He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card. The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players&#39; planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system.

But which of your fellow Witches serve the light, and which the dark? Gather information and form alliances, cast hexes, and use all your wit and connivance to ensure your dominance. Serve your Goddesses well, and they will reward you above their other followers, as they cast down those who dare to oppose them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coven is a game of secret alignments for 3-5 players in which each player represents a Witch serving either the darkness or the light.

In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roles&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Forensic Scientist x1&amp;#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &amp;ldquo;Key Evidence&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Means of Murder.&amp;rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Murderer x1&amp;#10;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &amp;ldquo;Key Evidence&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Means of Murder&amp;rdquo; respectively.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &amp;ldquo;Key Evidence&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Means of Murder&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Investigators x8&amp;#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &amp;ldquo;Key Evidence&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Means of Murder,&amp;rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Accomplice x1&amp;#10;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness x1&amp;#10;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169464/defenders-last-stand" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Defenders of the Last Stand</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.28</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Dice, Fighting, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Defenders of The Last Stand is a post apocalyptic adventure game by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Run Fight or Die, Defenders of the Realm) and Jason Maxwell (Agents of SMERSH, Superhero Solitaire) for 1-5 players set in the Western United States more than 50 years after nuclear war. Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand. Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city&#39;s survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of human amazons that ride large mutated beasts, a third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie&#39;s just recently and there weren&#39;t no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &amp;quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&amp;quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It&#39;s a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I&#39;m thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It&#39;s God&#39;s will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I&#39;m hoping we can start again. Me, I&#39;m hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it&#39;s where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don&#39;t know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &amp;ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be, unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We&#39;ll use it carefully. The Last Stand may be our last hope. I don&#39;t know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;--Taken from the Journal of Marha Bourne Star&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-dark-second-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Descent: Journeys in the Dark [Second Edition]</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) is a board game in which one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes.

Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible. As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.&amp;#10; The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick. After a full Round of ten tricks, whoever has taken the most cards in each suit once again gets a Suit Action. If a player has taken no tricks, that player gets two Diamonds Suit Actions.

Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they&#39;ve sworn allegiance!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory. The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game. Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172164/dohdles" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Dohdles!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.48</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Kn&amp;auml;tsel?!, a reworking of the 1988 Spiel des Jahres-winning Barbarossa, challenges players to create and decipher &amp;quot;kn&amp;auml;tsels&amp;quot;, i.e., kneading puzzles.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &amp;#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &amp;#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&amp;mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&amp;rsquo;t last: It is indeed &amp;quot;survival of the fittest&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &amp;#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&amp;mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&amp;mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &amp;#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&amp;rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&amp;mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&amp;mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&amp;#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &amp;quot;AP&amp;quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&amp;#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&amp;rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &amp;quot;VP&amp;quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&amp;#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &amp;quot;earth&amp;quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. &amp;#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&amp;mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplemented by&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Dominant Species: The Card Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162107/doodle-city" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Doodle City</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.37</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Line Drawing, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Doodle City is a quick family game of city building. By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &amp;mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution. Final scores are for connected taxis and for having least/most pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72132/dragon-rampage" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Dragon Rampage</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.52</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Dragon Rampage, a competitive fantasy game by Richard Launius, is a strategic dice game for 3 to 5 players.

Now it&#39;s time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you&#39;re injured twice, you die and are out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you cry like a baby, you don&#39;t draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166280/dragonflame" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">DragonFlame</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.81</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> You are a Dragon.

The king&#39;s power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king&#39;s region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100423/elder-sign" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Elder Sign</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.01</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Card Game, Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is 1926, and the museum&#39;s extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146021/eldritch-horror" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Eldritch Horror</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &amp;ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators&#39; personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &amp;ndash; or maybe you&#39;ll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &amp;quot;reckoning effect&amp;quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they&#39;re certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168/empire-builder" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Empire Builder</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.92</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1982</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Area Enclosure, Crayon Rail System, Pick-up and Deliver, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Epic Railroad Building in North America&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discover a modern North American classic. Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads. Use your initial investment to build track. Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand. Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair&#39;s crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America. Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns. For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train. The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff. Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player&#39;s demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173442/empires-age-discovery" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Empires: Age of Discovery</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.29</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 50 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Exploration, Renaissance</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Empires: Age of Discovery allows you to revisit the age of exploration and discovery.

Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. &amp;#30;The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&amp;#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&amp;#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Th&amp;#30;rough exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#31;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. Th&amp;#31;e game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player&#39;s Politics track. A player&#39;s influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. Once all players have passed, a new round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112686/epic-spell-wars-battle-wizards-duel-mt-skullzfyre" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Epic Spell Wars: Duel at Mt.

All of the explorers start in the center tile &amp;ndash; the safe room &amp;ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A cursed mask &amp;ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&amp;#10; A golden mask &amp;ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&amp;#10; A red torch or blue key &amp;ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&amp;#10; A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &amp;ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you&#39;re at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren&#39;t back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven&#39;t been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &amp;quot;Treasures&amp;quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &amp;quot;Curses&amp;quot; module, some tiles &amp;quot;curse&amp;quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn&#39;t want to do while escaping a temple!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133848/euphoria-build-better-dystopia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Euphoria</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> UPDATE July 1, 2014: 16 of the original recruit cards have been updated and revised for the second printing of Euphoria. Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they&#39;ve ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Euphorians aren&amp;rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&amp;mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&amp;rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker&#39;s knowledge&amp;mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he&#39;s in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&amp;mdash;especially matching pairs&amp;mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table. Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players. Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business. Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory. And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.

In a game with this little structure, it&#39;s possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread. Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&amp;#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&amp;#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop&#39;s Mitre.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church&#39;s (i.e. &amp;quot;your&amp;quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&amp;#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &amp;quot;mysteriously&amp;quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &amp;quot;Good Harvest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Good Weather&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Added Taxes&amp;quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &amp;quot;The Plague&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Heavy Rain&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Famine&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Peasant Uprisings&amp;quot;!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent&#39;s villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &amp;quot;f&amp;quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as &#39;add ons.&#39; These items are all still available directly from Academy Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is the most recent edition of Fief.

It&amp;rsquo;s unusual in that the players do not compete against each other, but compete against the game. This is a fairly new style of game called a co-op game or cooperative game. Players take on roles of the crew of Serenity and play through a series of Events. Using their Fightin&amp;rsquo;, Flyin&amp;rsquo;, and Thinkin&amp;rsquo; skills they attempt to successfully complete these Events to earn Credits and Honor. If the players run out of Credits or Honor before the end of the game, they all lose and the game wins! If the players manage to complete the predetermined amount of Events without running out of Credits or Honor, they win the game, and live to fly another day!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Double sized Character Cards &amp;ndash; Contains the Character&amp;rsquo;s Skill numbers and special abilities&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Event Cards &amp;ndash; These are the Events the players must overcome to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Serenity Cards &amp;ndash; These are dual use cards. The main use is to help the players overcome Events. It&amp;rsquo;s secondary use is to determine random numbers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alliance Cards &amp;ndash; These are penalty cards that are drawn if the players do not do well at certain Events. Draw too many of these and the players lose the game even if they still have Credits and Honor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gorramit Cards &amp;ndash; These cards modify the Events, generally making them harder.&amp;#10;A Set of Rules &amp;ndash; The rules to the game.&amp;#10;Honor Tokens &amp;ndash; These are used to track the player&amp;rsquo;s Honor.&amp;#10;Credit Tokens &amp;ndash; These are used to track the player&amp;rsquo;s Credits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Character Cards each represent one of the main Characters in Firefly. In addition to having their skills values listed, Each Character has special abilities, which cost a variable amount of Credits or Honor. On a players turn he can choose to spend Credits or Honor on one of these abilities, but it brings them closer to losing, so they need to think about whether they really need to or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A typical turn of the game consists of the active player turning over the top Event card. Each Event card has three challenges, one Fightin&amp;rsquo;, one Flyin&amp;rsquo;, and one Thinkin&amp;rsquo;. Each of these has a number, which the players must equal or exceed to be successful in the challenge. Characters gain skill two different ways, they may play Serenity cards to gain skill, and, after playing their Serenity cards, they add a random number to determine their final skill. This is added to the Character&amp;rsquo;s base skill number listed on their Character cards. Depending on how many challenges they successfully complete they either gain or lose Credits and/or Honor. The more successful the more they gain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the event is resolved, the next player starts a new turn, and turns over the next Event card. The game is over once all the Event cards have been drawn and resolved.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;The Firefly TV show is about surviving with honor. Mal and his crew are continually trying to scrounge up enough credits to keep flying, while maintaining their own personal sense of honor. The game reflects this grand theme with the victory conditions, survive the Event deck without running out of Honor or Credits. Each Event in the deck is tied to an episode in the show, and is easily recognizable by fans of the show. The Skills needed for each Event are tied to action of the episode featured on the card. A sub theme of the show is escaping notice of the Alliance, and again, with the inclusion of the Alliance deck, Firefly: Out to the Black delivers. The Alliance deck is an ever-present threat looming over the players as they desperately seek to finish the Events in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163170/firefly-shiny-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Firefly: Shiny Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.58</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> Firefly: Shiny Dice lasts three rounds, and whoever has the most points after three rounds wins. In each round, each player takes one or more turns. On your first turn in a round, you roll all fifteen dice &amp;mdash; seven crew dice (brown), three passenger dice (white), and five bad guy dice (black) &amp;mdash; then place them in the appropriate places on your display. Crew members and passengers all have unique abilities, some of which involve the option of rerolling dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After any rerolls, you reveal your mission for the round. If you have dice on your board that match the numbers given at the top of the mission, then you&#39;re unaffected by the bold line &amp;mdash; Bushwhacked, Gorram, etc. &amp;mdash; immediately underneath. Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Each Badger die holds one supply die.&amp;#10; Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold.&amp;#10; If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn &amp;mdash; rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice &amp;mdash; or end your turn. If you opt to continue, but then fail to defeat the bad guys, you lose all the VP that you earned previously on that turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After three rounds, whoever has the most VPs wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Flash Point Fire Rescue: 2nd Edition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.32</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Pick-up and Deliver, Simulation, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> The call comes in... &amp;quot;911, what is your emergency?&amp;quot; On the other end is a panicked response of &amp;quot;FIRE!&amp;quot; Moments later you don the protective suits that will keep you alive, gather your equipment and rush to the scene of a blazing inferno.

Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies.&amp;#10; Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.&amp;#10; Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.&amp;#10; Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.&amp;#10; Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is no &amp;quot;Alien player&amp;quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.&amp;#10; Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &amp;quot;recalibrates&amp;quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.&amp;#10; The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &amp;quot;alien signals&amp;quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Official FAQ: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/faq.php&amp;#10;Additional Missions: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/mission.php&amp;#10;Galaxy Ball: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/gb-cards.php&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/103343/game-thrones-board-game-second-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Game of Thrones: Board Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.77</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Fantasy, Negotiation, Novel-based, Political, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Auction/Bidding, Player Elimination, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What&#39;s more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141430/geek-out" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Geek Out!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.86</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Party Game, Trivia</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Geek Out! is a party game that can determine once and for all which player is the most knowledgeable about your favorite pop culture subjects!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, you draw cards asking you to list a certain number of things which fall under a certain category: comic books, fantasy, games, science fiction, and miscellaneous.

Whoever ends up with the biggest stack of loot at the end of the game wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game, each player secretly takes one of the five burglar tiles, which come in five different colors; each player also receives 2-4 helping hand tokens. Five locations are set out, each with two randomly chosen equipment tokens next to them; equipment tokens come in five types, with each type appearing in the five colors of the burglars. Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &amp;ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &amp;ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area. Thus, the burglars form provisional teams for the round and are trying to work together to rob a location &amp;ndash; any location! &amp;ndash; but they don&#39;t necessarily know who&#39;s who. On a turn a player either:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Chooses one of the face-up equipment tokens, places it next to a location (with no more than three tokens of the same type being allowed at a location), then reveals a new equipment token.&amp;#10; Draws the top equipment token from the stack, then places it at a location.&amp;#10; Plays a helping hand token to move a special token or add a new special token to a location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as all five types of equipment are at a location, a burglary takes place there. Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place. The car allows someone to move an equipment token to a new location. When the second tunnel is placed next to a location, the two locations with tunnels are now linked and the types of equipment present are considered to be together when determining whether a burglary takes place &amp;ndash; although if the lock is on one of those locations, then nothing can be stolen!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A brigadier token is shuffled into the final six equipment tokens, and when it&#39;s drawn, the game ends immediately. Players then reveal their identities, and the player with the most loot wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30539/get-bit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Get Bit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.25</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Bluffing, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Player Elimination, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> &amp;quot;You don&#39;t have to be faster than the shark, just faster than your friends!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values.

Collectors Edition contains Walk the Plank!, Get Bit!, and Hold Your Breath! &amp;mdash; three independent games that collectively tell a larger story.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Walk the Plank!, players represent the worst pirates in a captain&#39;s crew. The captain has rounded you all up because you&#39;re all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid.

In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before they run out of air and therefore decide to take a rest (aka LOSE). Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included in each copy is a bonus chipboard with a newly designed pirate ship, an additional &amp;quot;Captain&amp;quot; stand-up starting token, and even some hunger tokens to go with the now included Sharkspansion for Get Bit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128271/ginkgopolis" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ginkgopolis</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.43</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Environmental, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> 2212: Ginkgo Biloba, the oldest and strongest tree in the world, has become the symbol of a new method for building cities in symbiosis with nature. Humans have exhausted the resources that the Earth offered them, and humanity must now develop cities that maintain a delicate balance between resource production and consumption. Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards. To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles. Some tiles start in play, and they&#39;re surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, each player chooses a card from his hand simultaneously. Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles. Each card in your hand that you don&#39;t play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you add a new tile to the city, you take a &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; card of the same color, and these cards provide you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19857/glory-rome" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Glory to Rome</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.51</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Set Collection, Variable Phase Order</div><div><b>Description:</b> In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population. Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents. Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool). Players who don&#39;t follow may &#39;think&#39; to draw more cards. There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards. Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the &#39;black box&#39; edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

The lower the number, the better the rank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history. Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game&#39;s clever mechanisms can help balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch. The game board is a stylized version of the globe. The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events. Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation. Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events. There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few). Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires. One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn&#39;t gotten one yet. If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch. Then the next player draws and makes his decision. The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws. Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire&#39;s starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by). One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player&#39;s Empire is called.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand. The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire&#39;s actions. If the player&#39;s active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them). A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop). If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire&#39;s starting land with one unit of the Empire&#39;s available troops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer. To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it. Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender&#39;s land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from. In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well. If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense. Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker. In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort. On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land. Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues. Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered). After the active player&#39;s Empire is finished with it&#39;s actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then scoring takes place. Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch. One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land). Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area). These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example). Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player&#39;s color from all Empires controlled that remain on board. Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him. These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then. This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores. The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Online Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160968/homeland-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Homeland: The Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.94</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Memory, Secret Unit Deployment, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Homeland: The Game is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue, deception and hidden agendas.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game&#39;s main mechanism, which can be described as &amp;quot;bag-building&amp;quot;, involves you building a pool of &amp;quot;civilicubes&amp;quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies.

Up to fifteen deals can be made over the course of the game, and a player who is part of a successful deal will receive a certain amount of money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How much money? Well, that depends on whatever deal is made among the players involved, as negotiated by that round&#39;s boss.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player&#39;s turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player&#39;s illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &amp;quot;megabucks&amp;quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 1&amp;#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 2&amp;#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 3&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-published as:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Illuminati: Deluxe Edition&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CCG Version:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Illuminati: New World Order&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magazine Articles:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&amp;#10; European Illuminati - New cards.&amp;#10; &amp;#10; The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&amp;#10; Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&amp;#10; &amp;#10; Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&amp;#10; Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31594/year-dragon" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">In the Year of the Dragon</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.43</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 75 - 100</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Variable Phase Order</div><div><b>Description:</b> Stefan Feld&#39;s 3rd game by Alea is In the Year of the Dragon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000.

Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar.

The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&amp;#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &amp;quot;colleagues&amp;quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance of the &amp;quot;good old days,&amp;quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player&#39;s ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &amp;quot;holds&amp;quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &amp;quot;captain,&amp;quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and which to the &amp;quot;night.&amp;quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; - and one on the right (&amp;quot;night&amp;quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain&#39;s. When it is a player&#39;s turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice. Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &amp;quot;combat&amp;quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &amp;quot;gunpowder&amp;quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165959/jolly-roger-game-piracy-mutiny" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Jolly Roger: The Game of Piracy &amp; Mutiny</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor, Negotiation, Pirates</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the card game Jolly Roger: The Game of Piracy &amp;amp; Mutiny, you&#39;re a crew member aboard a pirate ship and have just elected a new captain.

Extreme weather with frequent and deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players&#39; teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. &amp;#10;You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127023/kemet" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Kemet</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Fighting, Miniatures, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Campaign / Battle Card Driven, Card Drafting</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Kemet, players each deploy the troops of an Egyptian tribe and use the mystical powers of the gods of ancient Egypt &amp;ndash; along with their powerful armies &amp;ndash; to score points in glorious battles or through invasion of rich territories.

During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles.

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player&#39;s own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players&#39; villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &amp;quot;Key&amp;quot; series from R&amp;amp;D Games set in the medieval &amp;quot;Key&amp;quot; land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257/kill-doctor-lucky" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Kill Doctor Lucky Board Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1996</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Murder/Mystery</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Point to Point Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In this notorious game, an inversion of Clue, you hate Doctor Lucky.

As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &amp;quot;Fame&amp;quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">King of Tokyo</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.34</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&amp;mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack.

Anyone who can&#39;t stay competitive will be left with nothing but dust in their coffers!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The process is simple: Factories produce the goods (machinery, textiles, chemicals, food, and luxuries) that are coveted by the city folk. Airships &amp;ndash; forbidden from landing in the cities but capable of carrying cargo over great distances &amp;ndash; must be used to gather those goods and deliver them to depots along the rail network.

When everyone is ready, everyone reveals their first planned card. According to the turn order and movement limits of their cards, players move their Airships, then take an Action; Actions include Building Depots, Upgrading your Airship or Train, Shipping Goods by rail, and Soliciting Funds from the bank. When all players have acted, the second planned cards are revealed, and so on through the four planned cards until all players have finished carrying out their plans for the round. All the while, players must keep aware of the rising values of the different types of Goods and try to get the most-valuable Goods from the specialized factories that produce them to the cities that want them. At the end of the game, the player with the most money and the greatest shipping network will be declared King of Air and Steam!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kings of Air and Steam includes seven teams of characters, each with unique powers to give them a competitive edge, and a modular game board that makes each game a different experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27162/kingsburg" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Kingsburg</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.25</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Dice, Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.

Once all the dice are placed or players have passed, in ascending order, the Elder Gods give their gifts to the Cultists who invoked them: the Cultists may have to lose Sanity points to receive the rewards.

In shifting teams of two that sit across from one another, players try to create skylines on challenge cards &amp;ndash; but the players can see the completed image only from their point of view, so they must consult with one another constantly to make sure each colored block ends up in the right location while racing against the timer.

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you&#39;re the first to run through the money on hand, you&#39;ll receive the rest of his inheritance &amp;ndash; oh, and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&amp;#10; Draw a card from any regular deck &amp;ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&amp;#10; Visit the opera and spend $2.&amp;#10; Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&amp;#10; Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &amp;ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &amp;ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain&#39;s attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain&#39;s particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &amp;ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &amp;ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what&#39;s available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player&#39;s turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &amp;quot;master strike&amp;quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game&#39;s end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &amp;ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &amp;ndash; then the players all lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156689/legendary-villains-marvel-deck-building-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Legendary: Villans</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.83</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Comic Book / Strip</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Deck / Pool Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Legendary universe gets flipped upside down in Legendary: Villains &amp;ndash; Marvel Deck Building Game, and you can now play as villains trying to take out the heroes protecting the city!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game remains roughly the same as in the first Legendary game as players can work both with and against other players to overcome obstacles that the game throws at them.

Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lewis &amp;amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &amp;quot;handbuilding&amp;quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players&#39; positions are crucial.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/45/liars-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Liar&#39;s Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.93</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1987</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination</div><div><b>Description:</b> Liar&#39;s Dice is a dice game where each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with.

As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;How to Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish. The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Design Notes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence. The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion. During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last. Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage. Lords of Scotland scales well to the number of players with most victories being determined in the final skirmish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110327/lords-waterdeep" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Lords of Waterdeep</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Take That, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Waterdeep, the City of Splendors &amp;ndash; the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings.

Use the characters surrounding you to increase your popularity, and earn money by attracting guests, the more demanding the better. Focusing only on increasing your popularity won&#39;t earn you any money, yet failing to spread your name won&#39;t make the rich or helpful guests come your way. &amp;#10;It&#39;s a matter of deciding which characters (cards) will help you increase your popularity and which character cards you want to attract as guests. &amp;#10;Once a player runs out of cards, the round is over, and all cards remaining in your hand become minus points, thus depleting your hand of cards quickly is important.

Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Building a hut requires that the space&#39;s landscape is &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &amp;quot;ritual sites&amp;quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &amp;quot;active landscapes&amp;quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &amp;mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &amp;mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &amp;mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63628/manhattan-project" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Manhattan Project</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.52</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Economic, Fighting, Industry / Manufacturing, Negotiation, World War II</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the back of the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Global Power Struggle Begins&amp;#10;Which nation will take the lead and become world&#39;s dominant superpower?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Manhattan Project makes you the leader of a great nation&#39;s atomic weapons program in a deadly race to build bigger and better bombs.

Probes have been sent to Mars, and soon astronauts will be manning rockets in order to mine the planet for newly discovered resources. The first is a brand new element, Celerium, that could prove to be a combustible energy source the likes man has never seen. The second is Sylvanite, an incredibly dense material unlike anything found on earth. In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet. Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From Bruno Faidutti&#39;s website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme. We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmod&amp;#195;&amp;#169;e. In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet. For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, &amp;agrave; la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet. Nothing really new here, but there was much work on it and we&#39;re really proud of the result.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118/modern-art" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Modern Art</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1992</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Commodity Speculation, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Buying and selling paintings is a very lucrative business, at least that&#39;s what Hollywood&#39;s led us to believe, and that&#39;s the premise of this game.

After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&amp;eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn&#39;t keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &amp;mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &amp;mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/915/mystery-abbey" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Mystery of the Abbey</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.55</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1995</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Medieval, Murder/Mystery, Religious</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Hand Management, Paper-and-Pencil, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit game with a twist.

Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players&#39; avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party&#39;s endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren&#39;t being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144479/myths-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Myths at War: The End of the Age of Men</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.96</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Deck / Pool Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Myths at War, first published as Guerra de Mitos, is a card game set in a fantastic world where different mythologies coexist.

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&amp;ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I.

After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Buy a card&amp;#10; Deploy a worker&amp;#10; Hire an architect for a wonder&amp;#10; Special action provided by a card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game.

Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108044/nefarious" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Nefarious</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.49</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your genius could have been such a boon to humanity.

They called you mad! You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &amp;ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you. Archimedes once said, &amp;quot;Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world.&amp;quot; You will be the most terrifying lever the world has ever seen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nefarious is a quick-playing game in which the players race to build inventions like a freeze ray, cloaking device, or robotic pet before their opponents can do the same. (Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a twist to the game, though &amp;ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time.

The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So!&#39; to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra. Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&amp;#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&amp;#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&amp;#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation. There are six &amp;#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game. Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue. Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen). The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board. A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks. If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost. However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on. After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card. The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Al Capone A description of this version:&amp;#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other versions/re-themes:&amp;#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game.

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags.

Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&amp;rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nightfall&#39;s base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Integrates with:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Nightfall: Martial Law&amp;#10; Nightfall: Blood Country&amp;#10; Nightfall: The Coldest War&amp;#10; Nightfall: Dark Rages&amp;#10; Nightfall: Eastern Skies&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">No Thanks!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are simple.

The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value. Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it&#39;s just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &amp;quot;do you develop your grain productivity &amp;ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &amp;ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won&#39;t get much?&amp;quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all the priests have been used, there&#39;s a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176361/one-night-revolution" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">One Night Revolution</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Science Fiction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> One Night Revolution (formerly One Night Resistance) is a super fast game of secret identities for 3 to 10 players that combines all the deductive and chaotically fun elements of the One Night Ultimate Werewolf series with more structured game play.

From time to time, when Caesar is especially impressed by your development, he may provide you with extra support.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Palmyra is a tactical tile-laying game with few rules and high tactical choices. By placing new land tiles and moving your army and censor, you earn new tiles and coins for the Roman Empire. The most important thing is to not be too greedy when collecting taxes; otherwise future income may become sparse. Additionally, don&#39;t let tiles placed by your opponents cut you off, or else you&#39;ll be forced to lose valuable time. When all of the 120 coins are collected, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most coins wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157789/pandemic-contagion" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pandemic: Contagion</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.56</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Medical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> After many years of trying to defeat the diseases that threaten mankind&amp;rsquo;s existence, the tables have been turned. You are now the disease and guess what? There is no cure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Pandemic: Contagion, you are competing against other diseases (fellow players) to see who can eliminate humanity. With no cure to be had, the one of you that wipes out all human civilization will come out on top as the most deadly disease ever known to man, may he rest in peace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic: Contagion includes a deck of contagion cards with differing colored borders, city cards with similar colored borders, event/WHO cards, player disease card and disease cubes. On a turn you take two of three possible actions, and you can take the same action twice. Those actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Draw contagion cards equal to your current incubation rate.&amp;#10; Advance one of three mutations to the next level.&amp;#10; Spread disease equal to your current transmission rate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the number of diseases equals the city&amp;rsquo;s population number, the city is wiped out. The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number. The two smaller numbers are awarded to those with the second- and third-most diseases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your disease card has three mutations: Incubation (number of cards you can draw), Transmission (number of disease cubes you can spread), and Resistance (number of cubes/cards you can protect). As an action, you can advance a mutation one level by discarding the required number of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Event cards are drawn at the start of each round and affect everyone during their turn. You might benefit from the card or it could have a negative impact. WHO cards are always bad, but your resistance will lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level, if you planned ahead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mid-game scoring occurs when the second, fourth and sixth skull comes out. When a city icon appears, a new city is introduced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150658/pandemic-cure" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pandemic: The Cure</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.44</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Medical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it&#39;s up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world&#39;s hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &amp;mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each turn, new &amp;quot;infection dice&amp;quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104581/panic-wall-street" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Panic on Wall Street!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.02</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 11</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Negotiation, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Commodity Speculation, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Panic on Wall Street! you take on the role of a freewheeling capitalist out to outmaneuver your competitors and earn your place as a great industrialist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are divided into managers and investors.

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player&#39;s stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can&#39;t change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &amp;ndash; and you&#39;re not required to do either &amp;ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &amp;ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What&#39;s more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn&#39;t give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37371/piece-o-cake" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Piece o&#39; Cake</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.60</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Children&#39;s Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Everyone knows the cake rules: one person cuts,the other chooses.

However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &amp;quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a &#39;real&#39; boy.&amp;quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &amp;mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio&#39;s nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &amp;quot;Angel Token&amp;quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn&#39;t true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2987/pirates-cove" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pirate&#39;s Cove</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.60</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2002</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fighting, Nautical, Pirates</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Pick-up and Deliver, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Come aboard and sail to Pirate&#39;s Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers. The tales of those legendary pirates of old who&#39;ve fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter&#39;s storm, you set sail to Pirate&#39;s Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate&#39;s Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each island (except Pirate&#39;s Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &amp;quot;tall tales&amp;quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &amp;quot;pirate&amp;quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate&#39;s Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.42</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1903</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Economic, Farming, Party Game, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> The original game was invented by Harry E. Gavitt and published in 1903 by Gavitt Publishing and Printing. In that game players deal and trade cards to corner the railway stock market. Be the first to get all the cards of one railway line, call out &amp;ldquo;Topeka&amp;rdquo; and you&amp;rsquo;ll win the hand!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But Pit, the more famous version, adapted by noted psychic Edgar Cayce, was first published by Parker Brothers in 1904 and in many editions since. In this loud, real-time trading game, players are given the task of cornering the market in one type of commodity. There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round. When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves.

The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder. The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&amp;rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&amp;rsquo;s rating for the current &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;. There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched. These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations. So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&amp;hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each player&amp;rsquo;s turn they draw an event card. These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city. Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don&#39;t stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime!

Some of them have &amp;ldquo;unknown circumstance&amp;rdquo; tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed. Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token. These tokens can later be used to help with tasks. However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances. The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for. If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.

You may also assign Workers to build new City Tiles or spend resources to meet Caesar&amp;rsquo;s demands to gain Favor Points. At the end of each turn, you will have to pay your Workers. Otherwise, the mood in the city will deteriorate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most of the actions your Workers will perform will help them gain experience.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &amp;quot;Trader&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &amp;quot;governor&amp;quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &amp;quot;large buildings.&amp;quot; Each player&#39;s accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="Q"><div>Q</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131260/qwixx" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Qwixx</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.90</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it&#39;s to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that&#39;s the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you&#39;re the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="R"><div>R</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ra</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1999</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Press Your Luck, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.

Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three &amp;quot;epochs&amp;quot; (rounds).

It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; card).

Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available. Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is preceded by the designer&#39;s other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas. Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace&#39;s Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Similar to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Steam&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133633/rarrr" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Rarrr!!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.74</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In RARRR!!, players first draft monster power cards in order to build their perfect monster, then draft power bid cards to fuel their monsters&#39; rampages through cities.

The game ends when someone completes seven objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181/risk" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Risk</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.57</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1959</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Negotiation, Territory Building, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Dice Rolling, Partnerships, Player Elimination, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Possibly the most popular, mass market war game.

Details on why this is important in the description.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &amp;quot;red stars&amp;quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s different is that Risk Legacy&#39; changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction&#39;s two powers, affix that power&#39;s sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &amp;ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &amp;quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&amp;quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &amp;quot;match three symbols&amp;quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &amp;quot;major bonus,&amp;quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &amp;quot;disposable&amp;quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique, and plays better than any other version of Risk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179719/risk-game-thrones" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Risk: Game of Thrones</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.31</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Movies / TV / Radio theme, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Risk: Game of Thrones, based on the epic HBO series, features two ways to play, including factions of noble Houses vying for control of Westeros during the time of The War of the Five Kings, as well as Daenerys Targaryen&#39;s rise to power in Essos.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;War and chaos have descended upon the realms of Men. In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. SKIRMISH&amp;#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. DOMINION&amp;#10;Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. WORLD AT WAR&amp;#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/634/river-dragons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">River Dragons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Point to Point Movement, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board.

The actions allow players to place plank foundations, place planks, move their pawns, cancel other players&#39; actions, or remove planks or foundation stones. As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160434/robin" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Robin</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.97</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Medieval, Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the fast-paced game Robin, you have just joined Robin Hood&#39;s merry men in Sherwood Forest.

Now imagine that you&#39;re bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other&#39;s path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player&#39;s desire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot&#39;s &amp;quot;registers&amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don&#39;t act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can&#39;t reprogram any cards to fix it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144344/rococo" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Rococo</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.59</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Age of Reason, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Welcome to the Rococo era during the reign of Louis XV when it&#39;s safe to say that holding lavish balls is quite trendy.

Each player has a map of the United States that&#39;s divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can&#39;t have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can&#39;t place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &amp;quot;guard&amp;quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &amp;quot;dupe&amp;quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round.

One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &amp;quot;Salem&amp;quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Not a Witch.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player&#39;s Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can also use green and blue cards such as &amp;quot;Alibi&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Stocks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Matchmaker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Asylum&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Scapegoat&amp;quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &amp;quot;Night&amp;quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate, the Constable chooses someone to potentially save, and the Spy chooses a Tryal card to look at. The other black card, &amp;quot;Conspiracy,&amp;quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &amp;quot;Conspiracy&amp;quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &amp;quot;She&#39;s a WITCH!&amp;quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177490/samara" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Samara</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 25 - 50</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Time Track</div><div><b>Description:</b> Travel back through history to a settlement called Samara, where you lead a group of builders.

The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &amp;mdash; but this comparison doesn&#39;t take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren&#39;t unlimited, you must do what&#39;s necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &amp;mdash; all of this is up to you! Ultimately it would be your honor to chose to die in a ultimate sacrifice in order to save the village. All of this is what makes the true samurai spirit!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128667/samurai-sword" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Samurai Sword</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.75</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Fighting, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Samurai Sword is a game based on the proven Bang! mechanisms and set in feudal Japan.

Players may have conflicting goals for the route to be taken as each tries to gain rewards for connecting different cities. Some branching is allowed but each line has a limited number of track pieces.&amp;#10; The particular cities which will reward individual players are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of identifying cards. The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city. Later in the game 4 short lines also become available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An updated version of Alan R. Moon&#39;s White Wind game Santa Fe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Summary&amp;#10;The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when 3 (or is it all?) track lines are completely used up. Each city&#39;s value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33604/say-anything" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Say Anything</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.89</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think.

But wait &amp;ndash; these aren&#39;t the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it&#39;s too late?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Reveals a rumor card.&amp;#10; Attempts a quest.&amp;#10; Accuses a knight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it&#39;s a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &amp;quot;It&#39;s time.&amp;quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan&#39;s forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur&#39;s kingdom falls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplements&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Shadows over Camelot&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172006/shadowstar-corsairs" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Shadowstar Corsairs</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.34</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver, Take That, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> As independent starship captains granted letters of marque by the ConFederation, the players vie for control of a dangerous but lucrative area of space known as the Shadowstar Expanse.

Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players&#39; heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &amp;ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp;amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it&#39;s a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp;amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp;amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121958/sky-traders" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Sky Traders</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Fantasy, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Commodity Speculation, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Command your own skyship and become a master merchant in Sky Traders, a board game of commerce and intrigue for two to five players. Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It&#39;s all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You&#39;ll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You&#39;ll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship&#39;s cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you&#39;ve angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As captain of your own skyship, you&#39;ll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&amp;rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FAQ &amp;amp; ERRATA: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3532&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31503/slide-5" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Slide 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Number</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players arrange their cards on the playing surface building &amp;ldquo;hills.&amp;rdquo; Once a hill gets five cards high, the sixth card will cause an &amp;ldquo;Avalanche&amp;rdquo; and that player must take all of the cards in the row, leaving the sixth card to start a new hill.

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &amp;quot;into decline&amp;quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depend on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy.

The mineral riches of the thriving Moon colony inspired legions of hearty Earth citizens to seek their fortunes in space. Humble rockets probed the farthest reaches of the solar system in an eager quest for resources, and brave colonists forged homes wherever they could survive. Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then the rumors began &amp;mdash; whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures. By the time the secret invasion was exposed, the aliens were everywhere. Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thus was born the Rocket Patrol &amp;ndash; an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions is a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142079/space-cadets-dice-duel" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Space Cadets: Dice Duel</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.98</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fighting, Real-time, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Partnerships</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your plan is quickly coming together.

The players are divided into two teams, each team playing the crew of a ship and winning or losing together based on how well they perform. The game ends when one side destroys their opponent by causing four points of damage through torpedoes or mines. Each ship has six Bridge Stations:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Engineering generates power for the other stations.&amp;#10; Helm maneuvers the ship on the map. &amp;#10; Weapons loads the torpedo tubes to attack the enemy. &amp;#10; Sensors locks onto the enemy so torpedoes can hit, and uses jammers to stop the enemy from locking on. &amp;#10; Shields helps protect the ship from enemy torpedoes. &amp;#10; Tractor Beams can grab the powerful crystals, move the enemy ship on the map, and launch Mines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is in charge of one or more of these stations, or has the overall role of Captain to coordinate everything.

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All was well in the galaxy &amp;ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &amp;quot;Wolf&amp;quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &amp;ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy&#39;s known history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders&#39; uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &amp;quot;Shepherd&amp;quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are a Sheep.&amp;#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&amp;#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&amp;#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&amp;#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Ewe&#39;s The Force...&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &amp;ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &amp;ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player&#39;s turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&amp;#10; Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&amp;#10; Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can&#39;t, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player&#39;s cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&amp;#10; If players have found a Defender, place the player&#39;s cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player&#39;s turn, Wolf attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can&#39;t discard enough cards &amp;ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &amp;ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155624/specter-ops" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Spector Ops</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Partnerships, Point to Point Movement, Secret Unit Deployment, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> A secret agent of A.R.K. has infiltrated a top secret Raxxon facility, attempting to complete three mission objectives before they escape &amp;mdash; but they are hunted by genetically modified Raxxon Hunters.

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&amp;rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&amp;rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&amp;rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&amp;rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you&#39;ll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166226/staufer-dynasty" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Staufer Dynasty</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Modular Board, Pattern Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In The Staufer Dynasty, the players are nobles in the 12th century, accompanying Henry VI on his tour of the areas of Europe brought under control by the Staufer family, an area that included much of modern day Germany, went from the Baltic Sea in the North to Sicily in South. You&#39;re eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take action in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom, and on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn&#39;t in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &amp;mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &amp;mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &amp;mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143176/steam-works" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Steam Works</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.35</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Industry / Manufacturing, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Modular Board, Tile Placement, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Inventors and tinkerers abound in the Victorian era, harnessing the power of clockwork, steam, and electricks to build machines capable of anything to give glory to Queen Victoria!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the steampunk worker placement game Steam Works, you&#39;ll put your mechanics to work collecting components and power sources, then you&#39;ll literally build devices by assembling those sources and components.

If you can outsmart your fellow pirates by using your brains and trading skills, you&#39;ll probably end up with the most valuable loot!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stingy is an interactive booty-swapping game for 2-6 players, with the booty in question being rum, parrots, coins, diamonds, and pirate flags; these first four items come in four colors, with 3-6 tiles of each item in those colors, while the pirate flags come only in black (as you might expect).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with six randomly drawn tiles, with the remainder of the tiles being scattered face down on the table or placed in the included pouch. On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp;amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it&#39;s impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &amp;mdash; but only for the complete groups that they&#39;ve collected. Whoever has the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &amp;quot;Captain Sly&amp;quot; variant in which an opponent who can&#39;t take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing.

Stockpile centers around the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&amp;rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137550/story-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Story War</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Mythology, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> It&amp;rsquo;s a card game for 3-to-8 players that combines storytelling and combat!

The aim in the game is to enlarge your fortune thanks to smart investments in rolling stock.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take on the role of investors who meet at the locomotive auction and try to buy the best of auctioned railway vehicles. Locomotive cards are not the only ones available for purchase though, because investors also compete for the most valuable railway wagons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played for three rounds, each of which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the players bid locomotive cards. The auction type in each round is determined by drawing one of the six auction tokens. During the bidding of locomotive cards, the players should pay attention not only to its price, but also to the multiplier placed on the card (the higher, the greater the potential profits) as well as the locomotive speed. Once all the players have already purchased three locomotives, the second stage takes place. In this stage they are attaching wagons to their locomotives. They also make a choice: either to take one of the face-up wagon cards and attach to one of their locomotives, to pass and do not take any card, or to pay for replacing cards on the table and only then decide, whether to take one of the available wagons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round is over when one of the locomotives of any player has its fifth wagon attached. Then, all the players are summing up the profits. Each player adds up the value of the wagons attached to the locomotive, then the obtained score is multiplied by the multiplier of the locomotive. This process is repeated for each of the locomotives. The earned money supplies the player&#39;s account. After three rounds, all the players add up their earned money. The player who earned the most, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Take a Train is an entertaining and exciting game, which gives everyone a chance to feel like a rail market tycoon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34119/tales-arabian-nights" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tales of the Arabian Nights</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Arabian, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Role Playing, Storytelling, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> From Z-Man Games Webpage:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan!

Travel the world encountering imprisoned princesses, powerful &#39;efreets, evil viziers, and such marvels as the Magnetic Mountain and the fabled Elephant&#39;s Graveyard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you: become beloved, wealthy, mighty - even become sultan of a great land. Choose foolishly, however, and become a beggar, or be cursed with a beast&#39;s form or become insane from terror! YOU will bring to life the stories of the inestimable Book of Tales in this vastly replayable board game with over 2002 tales that will challenge, amuse, astound and spellbind you for years to come.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Tales of the Arabian Nights&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30645/tammany-hall" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tammany Hall</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.32</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Negotiation, Political, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> &amp;quot;The way to have Power is to take it&amp;quot; - William &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot; Tweed&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city&#39;s growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor&#39;s grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization&#39;s influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 &amp;ndash; the era of Boss Tweed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;8 page rulebook&amp;#10;1 Game board&amp;#10;5 City Office cards&amp;#10;25 Green Immigrant cubes&amp;#10;25 White Immigrant cubes&amp;#10;25 Orange Immigrant cubes&amp;#10;25 Blue Immigrant cubes&amp;#10;35 Green Political Favor Chips&amp;#10;35 White Political Favor Chips&amp;#10;35 Orange Political Favor Chips&amp;#10;35 Blue Political Favor Chips&amp;#10;20 Red Ward Boss Markers&amp;#10;20 Yellow Ward Boss Markers&amp;#10;20 Purple Ward Boss Markers&amp;#10;20 Black Ward Boss Markers&amp;#10;20 Neutral Ward Boss Markers&amp;#10;15 Slander Chips&amp;#10;2 Council President Markers&amp;#10;1 Year Marker&amp;#10;1 Political Favor Chip Sticker Sheet&amp;#10;1 Drawstring Pouch&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181404/taverna" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Taverna</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> It is Saint-Averna&#39;s day, the holiest day in the kingdom of Averna.

The property owners receive gold and the innkeeper is rewarded if he fulfils the expectations of the patrons.

In others, the Renaissance produces a plutocracy, which leads to a utopia &amp;mdash; or perhaps to anarchy; it&#39;s all in the subtle details.

On your turn, you can change history, travel through time, and visit a point in history. You draw cards, play some of them for money and abilities, and score some of them to advance your power through history.

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group&#39;s skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group&#39;s special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers.

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&amp;ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner&#39;s circle looking in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&amp;#10; Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&amp;#10; Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What&#39;s more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other. The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned (triangle) raceway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best. An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/169652/turbo-rally-card-racing-thunder-track" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Thunder Track</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> THUNDER TRACK takes careful planning, patience, wit, and a healthy dose of foresight to become a champion.

Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, player&#39;s will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Integrates with&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&amp;#10; Thunderstone: Dragonspire&amp;#10; Thunderstone: Starter Set&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tichu</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1991</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Hand Management, Partnerships, Trick-taking</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tichu is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it&#39;s your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &amp;mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &amp;mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player&#39;s unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &amp;mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &amp;quot;Tichu&amp;quot; prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &amp;quot;Grand Tichu&amp;quot; after looking at only her first eight cards for a &amp;plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-ride" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ticket to Ride</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains, Travel</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn.

A DVD introducing players to the M&amp;auml;rklin line of model trains is included [Edit: DVD no longer included in recent runs.]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;M&amp;auml;rklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries. A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens. When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities. The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question. Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger. Moving along a player&#39;s own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through. A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game&#39;s longest route bonus).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154498/till-dawn" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Till Dawn</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Horror</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Don&#39;t get caught in the sun!&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Till Dawn, a 20&amp;ndash;30-minute game for 4-8 vampires (or 12, with the expansion), takes place over the course of three nights during which time all self respecting vampires leave their coffins to hunt.

The discs are stacked as a tower. A player turn consists of rolling the die and then hitting the tower with the axe. For example, if you roll a five, you have to hit the fifth disc five times with the axe. The player causing the tower to fall loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toc Toc Woodman Second edition: &amp;#10;A dexterity game where nine plastic tree segments are stacked up. Each tree segment has four bark sections around it. On their turn, a player gets two taps with the axe to try and knock off pieces of bark from the tree segments for one point a piece. But be careful, if a tree segment comes down it&#39;s minus 5 points! A quick unique dexterity game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Click Clack Lumberjack First edition:&amp;#10;Very similar to Toc Toc Woodman Second edition, but adds some optional grub stickers which you may apply to bark pieces in order to add various rules for the grub.

The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action. So, players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points. Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets. Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/138317/trains-and-stations" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Trains and Stations</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is the height of the Steam Age and the whistle of the Iron Horse harkens the boom of small towns across the country into major hubs of transportation and economic growth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Trains and Stations, a new take on train games, players must make deliveries, develop buildings, and profit from their decisions while working with and against other players.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else&#39;s, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player&#39;s tile may also extend your own path in a direction you&#39;d rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Theme:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &amp;quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&amp;quot;, and the game as a whole representing &amp;quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player&#39;s token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player&#39;s token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other notes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124172/tsuro-seas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tsuro of the Seas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Route/Network Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie&#39;s Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &amp;mdash; that is, keep on the game board &amp;mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn players add &amp;quot;wake&amp;quot; tiles to the 7&amp;times;7 game board; each tile has two &amp;quot;wake connections&amp;quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player&#39;s turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they&#39;ll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104363/rex-final-days-empire" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Twilight Emperium: Rex Final Days of an Empire</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.19</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting, Negotiation, Political, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Hand Management, Partnerships, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight&#39;s Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy&#39;s crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &amp;quot;spent&amp;quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol&#39;s fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet&#39;s surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol&#39;s own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet&#39;s wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player&#39;s military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction&#39;s leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game&#39;s asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Twilight Imperium: Third Edition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.91</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Negotiation, Political, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area-Impulse, Dice Rolling, Hex-and-Counter, Modular Board, Trading, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The &#39;designer notes&#39; in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from &#39;Puerto Rico&#39; to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of &#39;Settlers of Catan&#39;, while the &amp;quot;Command&amp;quot; system cleverly improves on the &#39;oil&#39; logistical mechanism of &#39;Attack&#39; to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Twilight Imperium (second edition)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire&amp;#10; Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="U"><div>U</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/60131/ugg-tect" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ugg-Tect</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.38</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Party Game, Prehistoric, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Partnerships, Pattern Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Ugg-Tect, first released as Aargh!Tect, players work in teams to construct fabulous &amp;ndash; well, let&#39;s say &amp;quot;functional&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; structures out of materials lying around them.

Faster characters tend to be weaker, but ideally they can get their best shots in first, with dice being rolled to determine the results of various attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each character card is unique with four characteristics important for attacks &amp;mdash; melee attack, ranged attack, speed, initiative &amp;mdash; and each character has two unique actions to inflict on others!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38159/ultimate-werewolf-ultimate-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ultimate Werewolf</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 5 - 68</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Horror, Murder/Mystery, Negotiation, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Role Playing, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your quiet little 16th century village has suddenly become infested with some very unfriendly werewolves...can you and the other villagers find them before they devour everyone?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition is the ultimate party game for anywhere from 5 to 68 players of all ages.

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&amp;rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city. Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&amp;rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&amp;rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&amp;rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner. Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden? In Urbis you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make decisions promptly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="V"><div>V</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27042/veritas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Veritas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Medieval, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Veritas is a Euro-style board game about the preservation of truth in Dark Ages France.

Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch&#39;s Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord&#39;s manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch&#39;s Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord&#39;s manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord&#39;s manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch&#39;s Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch&#39;s Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch&#39;s Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player&#39;s turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch&#39;s Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player&#39;s familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch&#39;s Scheme card.

If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There&#39;s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128554/voluspa" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Voluspa</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.73</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Will Thor survive the challenge of the trickster, Loki?

Who will be the first to use up all of his ingredients, and thus become the new voodoo master?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Voodoo Mania, each player starts with a hand of three cards and a reserve ingredient pile of 18-45 cards, depending on the number of players. One card starts in the center of the table. Each card is double-sided, and each side features four of five symbols on it (mask, amulet, voodoo doll, magic potion and top hat) in four of five colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players play at the same time, trying to play their cards in hand. To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says &amp;quot;Voodoo!&amp;quot; and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile. Whenever a player plays a card, he draws a replacement card to keep three cards in hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and everyone scores one point for each card still in hand or in the pile.

In 1625, the Thirty Years&#39; War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &amp;quot;years,&amp;quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &amp;ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one&#39;s control &amp;ndash; wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each of the &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After revealing that round&#39;s event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can&#39;t deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower&#39;s baffles to possibly emerge in the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wallenstein includes two expansions: &amp;quot;Emperor&#39;s Court,&amp;quot; in which a player&#39;s army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court&#39;s entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &amp;quot;Landsknechte,&amp;quot; which can be used with &amp;quot;Emperor&#39;s Court&amp;quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153905/warband-against-darkness" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Warband: Against the Darkness</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area Control / Area Influence, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Since the dawn of their civilizations, the great races of the Five Realms of Kholdrum, Shenaru, Ela&#39;Vethera, Lorendale, and Zhoni have been engaged in complex relations with each other &amp;ndash; allying and arguing, merging and dividing, loving and hating &amp;ndash; as they each schemed and plotted to gain the upper hand over the others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then the Darkness came. An army of unspeakable horrors of an ancient and forgotten race of infernal creatures awoke deep within the earth and marched across the lands. The Darkness ravished the Five Realms with death and destruction and nearly brought the continent to its knees. Faced with a desperate fight for their very survival, the great races put aside their differences and united into a warband of such magnitude and strength as had never been seen before. The world trembled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though their great loss of life on the battlefield was nearly insurmountable, the warband&#39;s sheer size overpowered the armies of Darkness and largely drove them back beneath the earth. Sorcerers and shamans and magi of the great races invoked binding blood magic to start sealing the enemy away for an eternity. In the final days of battle to determine the fate of the lands, the hordes of Darkness and the great warband clash on four remaining battle fronts that are each located near a border landmark that separate the kingdoms of the Five Realms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last four campaigns wage on. The end is near. May the Maker protect us all....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a player in Warband: Against the Darkness, you control the warband armies of one of the great fantasy races of the Five Realms.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson&#39;s diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes&#39; allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Watson &amp;amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&amp;oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &amp;#10;Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&amp;aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&amp;ntilde;ar&amp;aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&amp;oacute;n de una serie de casos in&amp;eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&amp;oacute;n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber&amp;aacute; sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra&amp;iacute;das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l&amp;oacute;gica deductiva.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Y, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu&amp;eacute;l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar&amp;aacute; la confianza del genio de Baker Street.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;El juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu&amp;aacute;les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar&amp;aacute; de resolver antes que los dem&amp;aacute;s.&amp;#10;Para ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder&amp;aacute;n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci&amp;oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&amp;aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&amp;aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&amp;aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&amp;uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&amp;aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&amp;aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.&amp;#10;Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&amp;aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&amp;oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes. Hecho esto, se devolver&amp;aacute;n las cartas de pista a su lugar para que los dem&amp;aacute;s puedan leerla en rondas posteriores.&amp;#10;Este procedimiento se repetir&amp;aacute; cada ronda, hasta que un jugador crea haber hallado la soluci&amp;oacute;n al caso: en ese momento, habr&amp;aacute; de dirigirse al 221B para comprobar si sus respuestas son acertadas.&amp;#10;En caso de ser todas correctas, habr&amp;aacute; ganado. En caso de error, habr&amp;aacute; perdido y se retirar&amp;aacute; de la partida.&amp;#10;Cada detective contar&amp;aacute;, adem&amp;aacute;s, con la inestimable ayuda de una serie de aliados de Sherlock Holmes, as&amp;iacute; como con la del propio detective y, sobre todo, la del buen Dr. Watson.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42448/we-didnt-playtest-either" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">We Didn&#39;t Playtest This Either</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many will enter, some will win.

Part of the fun is figuring out who the werewolves are on your team, but even then, you&#39;ve still got to outsmart them!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More specifically, the humans need to rid the town of werewolves in order to win, while the werewolf players need to eliminate human villagers so that the werewolves can overrun the town. To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager&#39;s hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident &amp;ndash; but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round. Who will live? Who will die? It&#39;s in your hands...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147144/whacky-wit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Whacky Wit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.73</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Collectible Components, Dice, Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Whacky Wit is a board game like none you have ever seen before.

At the start of each race, players receive a hand of five cards, with each card bearing a value from -4 to +5. The players&#39; pawns start each race on 0 of the racing track. Each turn, players choose a card from their hands and choose which pawn to move with this card, then reveal them simultaneously and move the selected pawns forward or backward based on the cards they played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After five turns, the race ends and the player in second place on the racing track wins, scoring a number of points equal to his position on the race track. All other players score nothing. (If the winner is in the negative portion of the racing track, he loses points instead.) After five races, sum all of the points scored; the player with the second highest total who has won at least one race wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This revised version of Why First? has new rules, including simultaneous actions by players that cuts down the playing time from the original release.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1382/winners-circle" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Winner&#39;s Circle</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2001</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Racing, Sports</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A re-issue by Alea of Knizia&#39;s Turf Horse Racing published by Gibsons Games. This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it&#39;s nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it&#39;s even crossed the start line. I&#39;ve never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game. There&#39;s also a sprint bonus in the race and a penalty for the last horse.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Republished by Face 2 Face Games as &amp;quot;Winner&#39;s Circle&amp;quot; in 2006.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Royal Turf&amp;quot; is #2 in the Alea small box series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122599/winter-tales" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Winter Tales</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.35</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Book, Card Game, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Partnerships, Point to Point Movement, Role Playing, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Following the victory in the Conflict of Autumn, The Regime of Winter has clutched the Land of Fairy Tales in its cold grasp.

There&amp;rsquo;s even an alternate ending.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62871/zombie-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Zombie Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.26</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Horror, Humor, Party Game, Zombies</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> Eat brains. Don&#39;t get shotgunned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Zombie Dice, you are a zombie. You want braaains &amp;ndash; more brains than any of your zombie buddies. The 13 custom dice are your victims. Push your luck to eat their brains, but stop rolling before the shotgun blasts end your turn! Whoever collects 13 brains first wins. Each game takes 10 to 20 minutes and can be taught in a single round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, you take three dice from the box and roll them. A brain symbol is worth one point at the end of the round, while footsteps allow you to reroll this particular dice. Shotgun blasts on the other hand are rather bad, cause if you collect three shotgun blasts during your turn, it is over for you and you get no points. After rolling three dice, you may decide if you want to score your current brain collection or if you want to push your luck by grabbing new dice so you have three again and roll once more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2471/zombies" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Zombies!!!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.92</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2001</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Exploration, Fighting, Horror, Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Zombies</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players take on the role of a survivor amid city streets sprawling with Zombies.

With a double-blind interaction mechanism that never really lets the tension ebb, a skilled agent will need to do a lot more than see through a bluff...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div></body></html>
