With a little luck and clever planning, you just might outmaneuver your fellow travelers and be the first to make connections for a complete ten day journey!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;Players begin by filling their tile holders, drawing and placing tiles into 10 spaces. Each space is a day of a player&#39;s trip. Each tile shows a country, a plane, or a ship. Tiles are drawn and placed one at a time, and cannot be moved once placed. Once all players&#39; holders are full, a face-down draw pile is made of the remaining tiles, as well as three face-up discard piles. On his or her turn, a player either takes a face-down tile from the draw pile, or a face-up tile from the top of a discard pile. He or she then decides whether to exchange the new tile with an old one. The tile not being kept is then discarded.&amp;#10;Players are attempting to have all 10 days of their trip connect, either by foot, by plane, or by ship. To connect by foot, countries must be adjacent or connected. To connect by plane, a plane of a certain color must be placed between two countries of the same color. To connect by ship, the ship must be placed between countries adjacent to that ocean/sea (or one ship can connect to another).

Each side tries to control the colonies, provinces and territories. They call on the aid of Native Americans, as well as the German Hessians and French Army in order to successfully birth a revolution or quell the rebellion. The four factions each use their own deck of cards to move their units into postions. Battles are resolved quickly with custom dice. If you can control an entire colony, province or territory you raise a flag. When the game ends with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the side with the most flag markers is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1775: Rebellion uses the same basic mechanisms as 1812: The Invasion of Canada, but to a different end result. The game is quicker (being 2-4 player) and the intermingling of units at the beginning of the game allows the action to start immediately. There are a few core rules that changed in order to better portray the goals of the war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game also comes with an advanced scenario, &amp;quot;The Siege of Quebec&amp;quot;.

One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has &#39;no chance&#39; element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham&#39;s 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, &#39;robber baron&#39; oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham&#39;s original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world&#39;s best railroad game developers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/423/1856" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">1856</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1995</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 300 - 300</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Route/Network Building, Stock Holding, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham&#39;s 1829, and adds several new elements.

It&#39;s been a millennium since the Armageddon. Deep in the Yucatan jungle, humanity has mutated, degenerated, and segregated into five clans: Jaguar, Snake, Monkey, Gar, and Bat. These clans now battle it out for dominance in the region, cooperating when it suits them and actively working against each other when the opportunity arises.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 3012, players start the game with small decks of Scout cards, which provide gold to make purchases. Two piles of cards &amp;ndash; an Ally deck and a Weapon deck &amp;ndash; provide static cards to buy, with three cards from each deck always available to purchase each round. Cards that are not bought remain there for other players to buy. Two non-static Action decks &amp;ndash; one with cheap cards, the other expensive &amp;ndash; are also available, and at the start of your turn, you reveal one card from each of these two Action decks. You get the benefits of the Action cards you reveal, whether you buy them or not, and they&#39;re removed from play if you don&#39;t buy them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you have amassed enough combat skill through Allies, Weapons, and Action cards, you can attempt to prove your worth by facing a beast in four decks of Encounter cards, ranging from easy to very difficult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unlike most deck-building games, there are many points of interaction in 3012, so players are never out of the action! And you always get to refill your hand to its maximum size at the start of your turn, so you are never penalized for interacting during other players&#39; turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when one of the Heroes reaches Level 5.

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that&#39;s below the card&#39;s number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/145103/7-days-westerplatte" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">7 Days of Westerplatte</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.86</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Wargame, World War II</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Chit-Pull System, Co-operative Play, Point to Point Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The German battleship Schleswig-Holstein began the bombardment of the Polish Military Depot on September 1, 1939, at 04:48.

Whoever does this best will win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck in 7 Kingdoms consists of 49 cards in seven types, with each type having seven cards in a particular number range: king (1-7), bishop (8-14), etc. up to peasant (43-49). Each number range has seven cards in it, with each being a different color and bearing a crest of that color. Each player starts with three cards in hand, and one crest card of each type is laid in a row, with one card placed face up next to each crest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, players take turn laying one card face up in front of them, then they resolve the cards from high to low. Whoever played the highest card places it on the opposite side of the leftmost crest card, then takes 1-4 cards from those on display next to the crests as determined by the power of the card played. Then the player with the next highest card goes, etc. Any cards unclaimed are placed to the right of played cards, then the row is filled with cards from the deck until seven cards are on display once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With each card claimed, the player can either add it to his hand (up to a maximum of three cards in hand) or place it in his scoring pile. Kings, for example, let you take any four cards on display, while generals let you take cards from three consecutive spaces, princesses let you take any two cards, and peasants let you take one of two cards from specific spaces. Thus, the low cards let you claim first, but put more restrictions on what you claim or have you claim fewer cards. The bishop scores himself, then let you place one of two bonus tokens on the leftmost crest card, reveal another bonus token, then claim one card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the deck runs out or each crest card has a bonus token, the game ends and players score any cards remaining in hand. Each card claimed is worth 1 point (except for kings, which are worth 2), and whoever has the most cards of a crest claims the bonus token on that crest, thereby earning bonus points or doubling his score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">7 Wonders</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Civilization</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you&#39;ll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you&#39;ve already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&amp;ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="A"><div>A</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217/la-carte" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">A La Carte</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.51</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1989</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Dice Rolling, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills.

Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone&#39;s plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets.

In this stylistic mash-up of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft, the worst has already happened and the world is now ruled by the Old Ones. However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &amp;ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &amp;ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112381/abaddon" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Abaddon</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It&#39;s the distant future, and mankind has taken a galactic leap forward through space, time, and technology. Life as we know it struggles to endure on the Abaddon. Once the home of a mysterious, non-human civilization, the planet is now a desolate wasteland bearing one immensely precious resource: Feronium power crystals. The unimaginable energy contained within the crystals is coveted by two groups of humans: the Satellite City-States and the Commonwealth Alliance. Using Links &amp;ndash; giant bio-mech suits made from modified military vehicles and alien technology &amp;ndash; the warring factions fight a weary battle for territorial control of the Abaddon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At your disposal in Abaddon is a 28&amp;quot; x 19&amp;quot; battlefield game board with 32 highly-detailed mech figurines, 18 free-standing landscape terrain features, over 100 game-changing Wild Fire and Weapon System cards, dozens of tokens, battle dice and a Battle Manual containing over 15 mission scenarios. Choose your allegiance and lead your army in non-stop excitement as you forge through unforgiving terrain, fight to overcome random and bizarre technological glitches, and battle your enemies in never-ending war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Abaddon is a furious, two-to-four-player game of futuristic combat. Each scenario is laid out on the customizable battlefield game board with each side using a varying number of units. The game is played in turns during which a player rolls his Activation Dice, allowing him to &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; certain units and move them. These mechanical units &amp;ndash; Links &amp;ndash; are powered by Feronium power crystals, and as they take damage these crystals are depleted. A unit that runs out of crystals is unable to continue functioning and is considered destroyed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is card- and dice-based. The attacker lays out his Weapon System cards, targeting defending enemy units. Once the attacker has laid out all of his planned attacks, the defender may defend with his own Weapon System cards. These cards can modify the dice rolls that are used to determine the results of the combat. Additionally, due to the experimental nature of the Links and the mysterious happenings in the Abaddon region, things can, and often will, go wrong. These malfunctions and odd happenings are represented by Wild Fire cards, the drawing of which can result in anything from possible shutdowns to anti-gravity surges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory is determined based on stipulations presented by the chosen mission scenarios. Typically, victory is achieved by damaging and destroying your opponent&#39;s units by way of their power crystals. Each destroyed enemy crystal is worth one victory point, which players must collect in order to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172818/above-and-below" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Above and Below</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.75</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Exploration, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Dice Rolling, Set Collection, Storytelling, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging.

The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure.

You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With any luck, you&#39;ll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they&#39;ve been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You&#39;ll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you&#39;re willing to sacrifice to succeed.

Despite having had a large number of paid employees, little was known about the agency until recently when Russia opened their archives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies set in an alternate 1970s timeline against a newly formed and independent SMERSH. Agents of SMERSH includes custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters, and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game. There are plenty of James Bond gadgets, guns, cars, pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor. The game features the artwork of George Patsouras (The Resistance &amp;amp; Flash Point).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is able to accommodate play with either The Encounter Book, which contains over 1500 written encounters with a similar reaction matrix to Tales of the Arabian Nights - or played more simply with only encounter cards with shorter encounters and no matrix. The First Edition (2012) of the game came with the Encounter Cards as standard, and the Encounter Book as an optional add-on (although many copies did actually include the book). The Second Edition (2015) includes the Encounter Book as standard, with the Encounter Cards available to purchase from the publisher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Agricola</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.09</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Economic, Farming</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Enclosure, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from BoardgameNews&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Agricola, you&#39;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you&#39;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner&#39;s version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&amp;#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you&#39;ll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&amp;#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it&#39;s important to do some things with high preference.&amp;#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it&#39;s a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents&#39; actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90419/airlines-europe" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Airlines Europe</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.38</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 75 - 75</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Route/Network Building, Set Collection, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> Before Ticket to Ride, before Santa Fe Rails, before Union Pacific &amp;ndash; yet after Acquire &amp;ndash; there was Airlines, one of the earliest published games from designer Alan R.

On a player&#39;s turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank.

His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &amp;quot;One Thousand and One Nights&amp;quot; collection of folk stories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &amp;ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &amp;ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players&#39;s influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &amp;ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &amp;ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/492/aladdins-dragons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Aladdin&#39;s Dragons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.94</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Arabian, Bluffing, Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Set Collection, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> After the immediate response to Richard Breese&#39;s Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&amp;#195;&amp;#188;ck Verlags-GmbH contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.

Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &amp;ndash; correct theories, that is &amp;mdash; and therein lies the problem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.&amp;#10;Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there&#39;s academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don&#39;t want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During play, players&#39; reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flavor text:&amp;#10;Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &amp;mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist&#39;s livelihood, science, and art.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &amp;mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see.

Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.

The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.

The game goes over five rounds giving a scoring after the 1st, 3rd and 5th round. Victory points are awarded for majorities of allocated buildings (very similar to the original game Alhambra). To get the buildings you roll 8 dice each showing the six building-symbols. Each player has 3 rolls on his turn to get as many similar symbols as possible (up to a max of 8). A player can only note his result for one type of building. The results of the dice rolls from every player is marked on the game board. So everybody can compare his dice rolls with those of the other players. After a round is completed the player with the highest dice-roll can choose between 2 buildings of the respective category or 1 building and a special counter giving a certain bonus. (Bonuses can be: additional 1-3 VPs, extra dice-roll, exchange one building, determine Starting player, etc.) The second best player in that category will get the other part. Each round has a certain number of turns depending on how many players are playing (3, 4 or 5 turns). So, because a player can only hit one type of building during his turn, he cannot score all 6 types of buildings in a single round. After round #1, #3 and #5 the majority in each building category is awarded the same way like in Alhambra.

An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring! This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system&amp;rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own.

You quickly set up perimeter force fields and begin surveying the surrounding terrain for debris from your ship, only to find it scattered everywhere. Then you see them &amp;ndash; at first only a few &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; scouts, but then the numbers begin to increase all around you: archers, slashers, and even the monstrous brutes. This is more than a scouting party; this is a war party! They begin to attack the shields as the crew starts to retrieve debris. The SOS has been sent and a ship in the sector has responded, but can it get to you before the &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot; overwhelm your crew? Can you repair parts of the ship and use it as a defense? Can you repair the hull and fire up the engine to lift off? It&#39;s all in the hands of the crew &amp;ndash; your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Alien Uprising, the player crew must either hold off the Zothren attacks until the rescue ship arrives, or repair the ship and lift off from the hostile planet before being destroyed. To achieve either of these goals, the crew must work together, using their unique skills and chosen actions to perform a number of tasks, defend themselves, and retrieve and repair equipment and the ship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To establish the actions available each turn, the first player rolls custom dice, then each player chooses an action for the turn, starting with the first player. The available actions include combat, engineering, reload/recharge first aid, scout, and wild; the dice also have an alien icon that shows the speed of the enemy while limiting the actions that players have available to them.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&amp;rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&amp;rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&amp;rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors.

The total number of animals in the collective is based on the number of players, but one animal in the collective will always be face-down. Each player also starts with one food crate and may never have more than five food crates at any time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, a player has two options: (a) split a collective of animals into two groups and take a food crate, or (b) take one of the animal collectives into their ark by paying a food crate for each animal in that group. As players choose their group of animals, they drop out of the turn. The first player to drop out of a turn starts the next turn. The game ends when an ark has at least ten animals on board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before scoring, all animals in pairs are discarded because a guy called Noah claims all animal pairs for himself.

The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play. Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn. A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby.

The game is fast, fun, colorful, and easy to learn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155068/arcadia-quest" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Arcadia Quest</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.09</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Modular Board</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own.

Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &amp;quot;come on&amp;quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character&#39;s own ego. Naturally you&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &amp;quot;Office Map&amp;quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105551/archipelago" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Archipelago</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.43</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Economic, Exploration, Nautical, Negotiation, Renaissance</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Commodity Speculation, Modular Board, Tile Placement, Trading, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago.

Cardis is a rich and powerful kingdom controlling all neighboring provinces, which provide valuable resources. All this wealth attracts warlords and raiding parties who more than often launch attacks against the kingdom. So far Cardis has stood against such attacks but with heavy casualties. Thanks to the support of wealthy Archons, the kingdom gets rebuilt so that Science and Arts can flourish once again. At the same time new soldiers are recruited and the army prepares for the inevitable moment when the kingdom will need to be defended once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Archon: Glory &amp;amp; Machination, players are powerful Archons who support Cardis in order to win King&#39;s favor.

For each of these Seasons, the King issues different demands that players must fulfill in order to score Victory Points. Each season consists of 3 rounds during which players use a card-driven worker placement mechanism to perform various actions that will allow them to gather resources and income, recruit soldiers and, rebuild the city, and acquire scoring cards (Science &amp;amp; Arts). They will also have the chance to train Elite Warriors to assist in the city&#39;s defense.

Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has an own set of &amp;quot;action tokens&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;build and modernize factories&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;employ new workers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;improve quality&amp;quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &amp;quot;Administration board&amp;quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (odd numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &amp;quot;Spinning Jenny&amp;quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &amp;quot;Waterframe&amp;quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12642/army-darkness-card-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Army of Darkness: Card Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Find the Necromonicon. &amp;#10;Recite the words. &amp;#10;Dispel the evil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Simple, right?

The proposal will affect five issues &amp;ndash; military, currency, etc. &amp;ndash; in various ways, and each player has a secret document for the round that tells him how a change in each issue will affect him.

Crystals on the players&#39; individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player&#39;s coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins).

Each god has a request and will help you to gain ground. You use the favor of the gods to aid your cause, and in return you appease their desires. In order to win you will need to appease the various gods in your deck. Appeasing gods requires dramatic losses to your position or the composition of your deck. When you appease the appropriate number of gods, the game ends, and whoever has appeased the most gods wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is composed of different landscape tiles: Mountains, Forest, Hills, Scrub, Bog, and Lakes. Each tile contains two different terrain types and an enchanted land. Players will create the board in the beginning of the game by joining the tiles together. City tiles are used to fill in some of the open square spaces on the map not used by enchanted lands. There are a number of different kinds of cards in the game: God Cards, Creature Cards, Town Item Cards, Enchanted Item Cards, and Event Cards. Players build a deck with cards to take over land and to battle each other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Asgard&#39;s Chosen plays with 2-4 players, and includes both a solitaire version and a two-player co-op version.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167400/ashes-rise-phoenixborn" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.90</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Dice, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, a two-player expandable card game, players take on the roles of Phoenixborns, demi-gods and protectors of this world. These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans&#39; greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140386/assassins-creed-arena" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Assassin&#39;s Creed Arena</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Assassin&#39;s Creed: Arena &amp;ndash; based on the Assassin&#39;s Creed video game series from Ubisoft &amp;ndash; players compete to uncover the best targets for assassination, but before you can go in for the kill, sometimes you have to deal with pesky guards as well as your opponents. Players will collect cards and treasure, move guards, and hide within the city of Constantinople until they find their time to strike. Combat is handled through cardplay, and the player who best manages his cards will have the best chance at victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each player&#39;s turn, he draws an Event card, which can spawn new targets in the outer city, move guards, or allow you to find a tunnel to another section of the city. Moving guards is a great way to get them away from you and place them near your opponents. Targets cannot be assassinated while a guard is nearby, but fortunately the guards can be dispatched if need be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards in hand drive the action, but they are also your hit points. If you run out of cards in hand, you die &amp;mdash; but just like in a video game, you will soon respawn at your starting area. Moving and attacking targets (or your fellow players) requires playing cards, so doing too much all at once can be risky. Couple that with trying to avoid the guards and you are in for a tension-filled game of cat-and-mouse. To replenish your hand, complete objectives on your movement cards or hide. Hiding in the outer city is easy and grants you lots of extra cards. When you enter the merchant district or the area around the palace, there just aren&amp;rsquo;t as many places to hide and you will not draw many cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is handled through cardplay. No dice are required, although a six-sided die is included to resolve some guard movement. Do you save your best cards for movement or to go in for the kill? He who risks the most has the chance for the most reward!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/827/attila" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Attila</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.53</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> In 375 A.D., Attila&#39;s mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of &#39;your&#39; tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don&#39;t have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129946/attraction" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Attraction</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> The reactive interplay between the magnets in AttrAction is what gives this game its spark!

In honor of next year&amp;rsquo;s 60th anniversary of D-Day, Avalon Hill will release Axis &amp;amp; Allies D-Day, a new, stand-alone extension of the classic strategy game Axis &amp;amp; Allies. Axis &amp;amp; Allies D-Day will allow players to recreate the largest amphibious invasion in history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Axis &amp;amp; Allies D-Day features detailed game components including a new blockhouse piece, an extra-large game board, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the D-Day game box. Other elements of this new Axis &amp;amp; Allies variant include a card deck with three card types -- Orders, Tactics, and Fortune -- to add depth and complexity to play. Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Axis &amp;amp; Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe.

Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the two other main Central Powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The major Allies, sometimes referred to as the Entente, consisted of the British Empire, France, Italy, the United States, and Imperial Russia. The alliance included other historical members, but they more or less fell under the command and control of one of these great powers. In fact, had General Pershing not insisted that its integrity be maintained, even the American army would have found itself as simply being replacements for French and British.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Axis &amp;amp; Allies: WWI 1914 puts players in charge of one of the major powers, each with its own infantry sculpt; other sculpts represent the artillery, tanks, aircraft, and naval line-up of either the Allies or the Central Powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As designer Larry Harris notes, &amp;quot;While playing this game, you will quickly realize that this is not World War II. There are no massive sweeps across continents with blitzing armored divisions and aircraft. Instead, there are a series of determined offensives resisted by equally determined armies dedicated to holding the line. You will find that your depleting resources of men and artillery must be deployed with great thought and efficiency.

The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else&#39;s) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens.

Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or &#39;Borgs as they&#39;re affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding &#39;Bots are on the way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it&#39;s hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past.

In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &amp;quot;mini-game&amp;quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game&#39;s highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent&#39;s pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both?

But beware, as your hold on the city increases, so does the chance of your plans being foiled by Gotham&#39;s protector &amp;ndash; Batman!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, players collect resources of information, money and threat; threat is used to exert your rule over blocks in Gotham City, and control of blocks allows you to collect income on these blocks of either information or money. Money is used for leveling and to hire henchmen who will help you rule city blocks and fight better against other villains and Batman.

They will build roads and cities and send their heroes to battle - every opponent will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so eventually the player could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if a player is lucky enough and the others let him ... :). Battalia has 2 game end conditions - full conclusion of the game board or first player, who achieves 5 cities of level four, immediately ends the game. The winner is the player with the most victory points at the and of the game and this is not necessary the same person, who made the final cut!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An immersive game play will provide the opportunity for the players to make key decisions and turn the tides of even the grimmest of outcomes. A player can outmaneuver and BE outmaneuvered by his opponents at any point in the game.&amp;#10;Dynamic atmosphere and intense battles are key factors in the overall experience, however the game strives to stimulate analytic thinking and strategy over rash and impulsive decisions.&amp;#10;In general this is not a luck based game, because of the core deck building mechanics, but a die is integrated as an optional element and is the ingredient, which spices up the game for all the fortunate fellows! You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.&amp;#10;The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The calendar mechanics is implemented in the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players (every day a different one) and it could support them, if they catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides the leaders through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands: The B&amp;auml;rfolk, The Emberians, The Islanders and The Cloudborn.&amp;#10;Four factions coexist in the world of Battalia. Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players :) ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123160/battle-souls" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Battle for Souls</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.31</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Religious</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management, Partnerships, Press Your Luck, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Battle For Souls is a card game pitting the seven archangels of heaven versus the seven princes of hell in a fight for the eternal souls of humankind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, 1, 2, or 4 players choose the side of heaven or the side of hell. Each side will battle for 28 souls, which are worth victory points. Players add holy or unholy points on the souls in play based on how they use temptation, virtue, sin, intercession, holy relic, unholy relic, angel and devil cards. Earn enough holy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to heaven, earning the side of good victory points; earn enough unholy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to hell, earning the side of evil victory points. If a soul does not earn enough holy or unholy points and is reaped, it goes to purgatory where its victory points are not counted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Guiding a soul to complete purity or complete darkness before death and final judgment adds a new archangel or prince of hell to a player&#39;s arsenal. Influence on souls can be spent for more powerful cards that have special abilities, and allow a player to gain souls more quickly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many strategic decisions impact play. Strategies include focusing on gaining more help from heaven or hell to increase your power, working to reap souls quickly from the start with little intervention from the angelic and demonic hordes, or balancing your play to ensure victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sin, Intercession, and Relic cards can be purchased for beneficial effects at the cost of holy and unholy points. These help to make for deep gameplay and excellent risk-reward scenarios.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&amp;hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don&#39;t match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Official Site, Rules &amp;amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;amp;esem=4&amp;#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191624/bear-valley" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bear Valley</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.16</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> In Bear Valley, you must be the first to survive the treacherous wilderness and escape to the safety of the camp at the end of the valley.

To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&amp;#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME CHARACTERISTICS&amp;#10;The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck.

They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you&#39;ve spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn&#39;t help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors&#39; warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they&#39;ve just freed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &amp;mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132428/bioshock-infinite-siege-columbia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bioshock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.09</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting, Miniatures, Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Betting/Wagering, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the tabletop game BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia, players will play as either the Founders or the Vox Populi and will build up an army to fight for control of Columbia by taking ground and completing important objectives.

All those pirates you loved - Black Bart Roberts, Long Ben Avery, Ned Lowe, L&#39;Ollonais, and, of course, Edward Teach (Blackbeard) - 23 in all, are still there, as are the King&#39;s Commissioners sent out to stop them. However, the entire play system has been overhauled, and the result is a game that highlights and specializes in player interaction, with almost no down time for any players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players represent individual pirates, using them to gain Victory Points by amassing booty and, even more importantly, earning Notoriety for their dastardly deeds. Seizing merchants with cargo ranging from useless paper to the monumental treasure of the Mughal emperors, attacking and sacking ports, fighting storms and scurvy, seeking safe haven in infamous pirate ports such as Tortuga and Madagascar, and, hopefully, using Letters of Marque to retire successfully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And while the player is doing this, all of the other players, at the same time, are playing their cards and seizing opportunities to stop the pirates.

Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board. The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square. Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.

It&amp;rsquo;s the Vikings&amp;rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&amp;rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan&#39;s stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&amp;ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &amp;ldquo;Gods&amp;rsquo; Gifts&amp;rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&amp;rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/89222/bloodsuckers" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bloodsuckers</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.00</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fighting, Horror</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area Control / Area Influence, Hand Management, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> The once quiet small town of Blackwood has become a battleground.

You, your fellow members of the Retro City Bomb Squad, and your trusty Bomb Squad Robot are the only barriers in the way between those dastardly villains and the innocent civilians of Retro City. Lives are at stake &amp;mdash; and time is ticking &amp;mdash; so let&#39;s go!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bomb Squad is a cooperative game in which 2-6 players are members of a team operating a disposal robot with the mission to disarm bombs and save hostages. The players work together, racing against the clock to provide the appropriate instructions for the robot to achieve their mission objectives. Bomb Squad features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Real-time play: Players each take a turn in clockwise order and are free to take as long as they want on their turn. However, there is a timer counting down in real time until the bombs will detonate, so players will want to be as efficient as possible. &amp;#10; Hidden Card Information: Players hold their cards so that the fronts are facing the other players, which requires that players give each other Intel to figure out which cards they have in hand. &amp;#10; Limited Communication: While players have their cards up and visible to each other, players are allowed to communicate only via the Intel they give each other, which provides hints about the cards they have in their hands.

The instructor has rigged three training bombs for you and your team to defuse, but little do you know that there is no way to actually defuse them! The bombs will explode eventually, and if you want to graduate at the top of the class then you&amp;rsquo;ll want to cut high-value wires without triggering the explosives! Grab your wire cutters and steady that shaky hand, because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be an explosive night!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Bomb Squad Academy there are four decks of cards representing the four &amp;ldquo;wires&amp;rdquo; of the bomb, and a trigger track next to each deck. Every round, each player secretly decides (then simultaneously reveals) the wire that they will cut this round (or perhaps they&amp;rsquo;ll chicken out, or even call &amp;ldquo;Wait!&amp;rdquo; preventing a wire from being cut). After actions are revealed, the chosen wires are &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; by flipping cards from those decks. When a card is flipped, its value dictates how far the trigger moves down the trigger track and how many points are earned; cutting wires alone is worth a lot more than cutting the same wire as other players. Push the triggers too far and the bomb will explode! Whoever causes the bomb to explode loses points. Players earn useful Tools during the game that they can use to break the rules.

The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you&#39;ll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on. Place a low number and you&#39;ll get a worse action &amp;ndash; but you&#39;ll possibly block other players from taking the action at all as in order to take an action you must place a die on it with a lower number than any die already on the action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three task tiles on a player&#39;s individual game board provide some direction as to what he might want to do, while god tiles allow for special actions and rule-breaking, as gods are wont to do.

Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &amp;mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &amp;quot;build phase&amp;quot; is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a standalone card game with 155 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720/brass" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Brass</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Brass the players represent industrialists in northern England during the heyday of the industrial revolution. Each player needs to build an economic engine that surpasses the other by the time railways are established and the foreign markets have been saturated with English cotton.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game. These are obtained in three ways: &amp;#10;1) Building industries and having them successfully utilized &amp;#10;2) Building canal or rail connections to cities that have many successfully utilized industries &amp;#10;3) money at the end of the game (very inefficient).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play is divided into two phases - the Canal Phase and the Rail Phase. At the beginning of each phase players are dealt a hand of cards that represent a mix of the cities and the available industries.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;On his turn, a player has two actions (except first turn of the game where there is only one action) and must spend a card for each one. Available actions include: &amp;#10;1) building an industry&amp;#10;2) building a connection [either canals or rails based on phase of the game]&amp;#10;3) developing their own industries which removes lower victory point industries from a player&#39;s board in favor of higher victory point ones&amp;#10;4) selling cotton&amp;#10;5) taking a loan (absolutely necessary a few times a game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of a player&#39;s turn they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn - from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanic opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order allowing possibility of back-to-back turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (deck size adjusted for number of players) the Canal Phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, new cards are dealt and the Rail Phase begins. Rail Phase is identical to Canal Phase except players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the Rail Phase there is another scoring round and a winner is crowned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The use of the cards limit where you can build your industries but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or building connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source which may be an opponent&#39;s coal mine which gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e. being utilized).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[Side Note]&amp;#10;Brass provides a game of timing and positioning yourself to have your opponents propel you to victory. The rule book is notorious for being difficult to understand (though has been significantly fixed in the most recent edition). After a few turns the game reveals itself as being far more simple than the rules suggest. A teacher or viewing a how to play video is definitely worth the time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137237/bremerhaven" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bremerhaven</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.52</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Pick-up and Deliver, Time Track, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bremerhaven is a clearly structured but complex economic game about the famous harbor town in the north of Germany.

All of the action is geared toward the gathering of prestige, with the most prestigious merchant winning in the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144592/bruxelles-1893" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Bruxelles 1893</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 50 - 125</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Modular Board, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Bruxelles 1893 is a worker placement game with elements of bidding and majority control. Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yield the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money &amp;ndash; acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige &amp;ndash; while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they&#39;ve placed their workers next to on the action board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they&#39;ve completed their work, and their money on hand.

Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the pollution isn&#39;t stopped, it&#39;s game over for all of us.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game CO&amp;#226;&amp;#130;&amp;#130;, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &amp;mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In CO&amp;#226;&amp;#130;&amp;#130;, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant.

The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a player&#39;s turn, she places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space. Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they&#39;re next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp;amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp;amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp;amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&amp;rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&amp;rsquo;s progress lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159503/captain-dead" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Captain is Dead</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.42</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Imagine that you are one of the crew in your favorite science fiction TV show.

The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter. Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning. For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand. Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.

When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This big box includes the basic game, Inns &amp;amp; Cathedrals, Traders &amp;amp; Builders, Princess &amp;amp; Dragon and The Tower.

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don&#39;t want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/103877/casa-grande" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Casa Grande</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Building, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Casa Grande players try to develop well-located building lots in order to construct large and tall buildings on them. Opponents can use your buildings for their own purposes, and the final result should be one large magnificant house &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;casa grande&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; after another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Casa Grande is played on a game board that shows a square grid for the building area, which is framed by a track. At the start of the game, each player receives a number of building blocks and differently-shaped platforms. Each player also receives five bonus points and one pawn, which is placed on the track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in turns with some elements being similar to Burkhardt&#39;s own Kupferkessel Co. At the start of his turn, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn forward on the track as many spaces as the number rolled. By expending bonus points, the player may move his pawn further. Then, the player must place one building block on the board in the column or row corresponding to the space on the track where his pawn is located. If he now has the building blocks needed to support one of his platforms, he may place that platform on top of the building blocks. If he does so, he gains an amount of money (Casa Grande Lire) based on the size of the platform and the level at which it was built.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a platform has been added, building blocks may be added on top of the platform. If another player builds on top of your platform, you gain a number of bonus points. You also gain bonus points if your pawn ends its move on a corner (in which you don&#39;t get to place a building block). If a player accumulates nine or more bonus points, he receives nine Casa Grande Lire, but loses the bonus points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends at the end of the round in which a player has placed his last building block.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round players take their turns in the current turn order. During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice. In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board. If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155426/castles-mad-king-ludwig" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Castles of Mad King Ludwig</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.82</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Post-Napoleonic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Pattern Building, Set Collection, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time.

Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he&#39;s building while also selling his services to other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It&#39;s up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies.

To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players embody master builders. By building the King&#39;s castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King&#39;s favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game. The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175117/celestia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Celestia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Aviation / Flight, Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Celestia, a revamped version of Cloud 9, you board an aircraft with a team of adventurers to perform many trips through the cities of Celestia and recover their wonderful treasures.

Whoever controls this &amp;quot;cosmic egg&amp;quot; can shape the birthing of the next universe according to their own agenda. Players are secret agents from a handful of surviving worlds, zipping from planet to planet in special &amp;ldquo;amnion suits&amp;rdquo; that allow for interstellar travel, space combat and planetary landings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each planet has its own envelope of cards. When you arrive on a planet, you decide which cards you want to take and which to leave behind. Knowledge is the most powerful resource in the game, and being able to predict the cards your opponents possess at any given time is a powerful advantage as you build up a handful of weapons, tactical gear, vaults and traps, as well as cards that counter your opponents&#39; cards. The best players will keep their hand fluid, constantly changing tactics while they search from world to world for the Ovoid or find a safe place to stash it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Balance your hand of cards, spend your turn actions wisely, and cleverly use your special alien powers to stay one step ahead of your opponents.

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns as follows:&amp;#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Make &amp;quot;variable&amp;quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &amp;quot;uninvited&amp;quot; people in a player&#39;s room, he or she may also roll to &amp;quot;get rid of&amp;quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-If any of the player&#39;s in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &amp;quot;uninvited&amp;quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player&#39;s room. (See above for &amp;quot;getting rid of&amp;quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don&#39;t require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &amp;quot;called&amp;quot;) can also be played in this round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-For each unit of free time the player&#39;s Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &amp;quot;Whenever&amp;quot; cards which can be played at any time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player&#39;s Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player&#39;s total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31730/chicago-express" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Chicago Express</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Route/Network Building, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> Harry Wu&#39;s Chicago Express is an innovative new boardgame with no luck factor.

Produce carts are commonly found in each village marketplace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Cinque Terre, a game of strategy, players compete to sell the most valuable produce in the five villages. Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Game Set Up and Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&amp;#10; Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&amp;#10; Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&amp;#10; Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/478/citadels" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Citadels</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.17</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, City Building, Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings.

At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&amp;uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

These offices deal with a different aspect of building the city or campaigning, such as the Tax Assessor, Surveyor, or Zoning Board. In a round, each player will get to activate one of these offices. However, just because you activate an office doesn&#39;t mean you will get to use it. The other players will have an opportunity to use their influence to steal control of the office away from you. Keeping it will require countering with your own influence. However, you can instead let another player control that office this round and add their influence to your own, giving you a leg up on controlling things later on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In using these offices, players will buy land and build properties to create attractive neighborhoods that will bring the most people into the city &amp;ndash; or they might place a factory next to an opponent&#39;s housing complex to drive people out. They will also tax their constituents to raise funds (with the option of sacrificing popularity to tax at higher rates), buy and sell influence to the Lobbyist, and campaign to increase their approval level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, the citizens of the city will vote based on which player brought them in and that player&#39;s approval level.

Players take turns placing and developing settlements in order to claim a variety of domains and their respective advantages. In order to secure victory, the players must cultivate a well balanced nation. One rich in technology, settlements &amp;amp; farms, markets &amp;amp; exotics, as well as, temples &amp;amp; sacred sites.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Specifically, the players claim domains by building camps, upgrading those camps to villages, and ultimately into great cities. The various settlement types project varying degrees of influence over the domains. By controlling the domains,the players will earn a number of different victory point multipliers (including farms, markets, temples, and sacred sites). In addition the players will use their settlements to control three kinds of resource dice (forest, mountain, and desert dice). Each respective dice type offers a unique set of odds for resource procurement (forest dice offer much wood, some clay, and an occasional exotic good; mountain dice offer much stone, some metal, and an occasional exotic good; finally desert dice offer equal odds of wood, stone, clay, and metal, with a greater chance for exotic goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game, the players will strive to attain victory points on 4 tracks:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Subsistence (farms x settlement score [village = 1, city = 3]).&amp;#10;Commerce (markets x exotics)&amp;#10;Theology (temples x sacred sites)&amp;#10;Technology (single score, no multiplier)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over the course of six rounds of scoring (six generations), the players will compete for the highest final score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40765/clash-cultures" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Clash of Cultures</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.72</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, City Building, Civilization, Economic, Exploration, Medieval, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Trading, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> From Christian Marcussen, the creator of Merchants and Marauders, comes Clash of Cultures, a civilization game in which each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire. Players must explore their surroundings, build large cities, research advances and conquer those who stand in the way. The game features a modular board for players to explore, 48 distinct advances, seven mighty wonders, and loads of miniatures and cards. The winner will create a culture that will be remembered and admired for millennia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Advances&amp;#10;The game features about 48 distinct advances. The whole &amp;quot;tech-tree&amp;quot; is very flexible with no dead ends, yet still intuitive, sensible and &amp;quot;realistic.&amp;quot; Additionally you have a great overview of what advances other cultures have - no need to ask - just look.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Modular Board&amp;#10;Players start with a civilization in its infancy.

Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone places their passenger token into the balloon&#39;s basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different &amp;quot;pilot&amp;quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company&#39;s weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Phase 1: Schemin&#39; Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&amp;#10; Phase 2: Stealin&#39; The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player&#39;s best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they&#39;ll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; card when you&#39;re in a train car that holds one of these items &amp;mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you&#39;ll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he&#39;s collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player&#39;s character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you&#39;re running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent&#39;s deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he&#39;ll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124361/concordia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Concordia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.91</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 100 - 100</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Economic, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities.

Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&amp;#10; They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent&#39;s moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold, the game ends.

These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player&#39;s Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World&#39;s Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World&#39;s Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Warzone: Each player&#39;s Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39463/cosmic-encounter" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Cosmic Encounter</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.61</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Negotiation, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Take That, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the Manufacturer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp. Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock. This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player&#39;s turn, he or she becomes the offense. The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet. The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials. He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card. The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players&#39; planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194100/costa-rica" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Costa Rica</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.76</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Different sets of exotic animals, different terrains, and the omnipresent danger of mosquitos await in the jungle of Costa Rica, and the player explorers are here to collect sets of rare and exotic animals to rescue them from poachers.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &amp;ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.&amp;#10; Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player&#39;s character.&amp;#10; Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.&amp;#10; Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.&amp;#10; Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Income: Take one coin from the treasury.&amp;#10; Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.&amp;#10; Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you take one of the character actions &amp;ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else&#39;s action &amp;ndash; that character&#39;s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can&#39;t (or don&#39;t) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you&#39;re out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last player to still have influence &amp;ndash; that is, a face-down character &amp;ndash; wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new &amp;amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp;amp; Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters.

But which of your fellow Witches serve the light, and which the dark? Gather information and form alliances, cast hexes, and use all your wit and connivance to ensure your dominance. Serve your Goddesses well, and they will reward you above their other followers, as they cast down those who dare to oppose them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coven is a game of secret alignments for 3-5 players in which each player represents a Witch serving either the darkness or the light.

Deducing which Goddess(es) and which other player(s) share your alignment will make your strategy clear and victory easier to achieve, but not guaranteed by any means. Gameplay is deceptively simple, with five possible actions as players traverse a circular board with an inner pentagram rotating widdershins changing tactics with each rotation. Coven presents an interesting strategic challenge: the side (Light or Dark) that scores the most Balance defeats the opposing side &amp;mdash; but on the dominating side, only the Witch that scores the most Power can win, so players must be careful not to invest too much in one while neglecting the other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coven includes five playable characters (along with their miniatures) &amp;ndash; Witches of Earth, Water, Spirit, Air and Fire. The game also includes a Goddess Power/Balance board, Black and White magic crystals, hidden alignment tokens, &amp;quot;reversal&amp;quot; alignment crosses (for players who dare to change sides), Artifact Cards and Balance cards, a Goddess Board, and a two piece circular playing board with a rotating pentagram.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181246/crazy-bullets" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Crazy Bullets</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, American West, Card Game, Humor, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Recognition</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the Wild West, gun fights are always the best practice to resolve a dispute &amp;mdash; but what happens when bullets blasted from a revolver go crazy and start to follow their own path?

Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game.

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&amp;uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&amp;rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&amp;iacute;var. Castro&amp;rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Castro&amp;rsquo;s Insurgency&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following up on GMT Games&amp;rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution. Castro&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;26 July Movement&amp;rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana. Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro. Batista&amp;rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors: its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim. And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COIN Series, Volume II&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&amp;mdash;both volumes share the same innovative GMT COIN Series system. Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&amp;mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss. But Cuba Libre&amp;rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new. A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The Twelve: The first wave&amp;rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&amp;mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; El Che and Ra&amp;uacute;l: Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Operation Fisherman: Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; General Strike: Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Radio Rebelde: Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Pact of Caracas: Can the rebels unite?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Armored Cars: Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Rolando Masferrer: Brutal pro-government tactics&amp;mdash;will they help or hurt?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Fat Butcher: Can the Mob&amp;rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Sinatra: Frankie&amp;rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&amp;#10;&amp;hellip; and much more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; It&amp;rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The Syndicate&amp;rsquo;s bases are Casinos&amp;mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them. &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &amp;ldquo;muscle&amp;rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets. &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&amp;rsquo;s hands&amp;mdash;even the corrupt Government&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&amp;mdash;reprisals&amp;mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&amp;mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More COIN Series Volumes to Come&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series. Volume III is A Distant Plain&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;Insurgency in Afghanistan.

Once rescue arrives, it&#39;s up to each player to leave the safety of the cabin and make it out alive!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To fight the zombies, players use cabin cards, some of which are weapons that help players attack zombies at a distance or in hand-to-hand combat. If characters take too many injuries during combat, they die and return to the game as a zombie with customized rules as a member of the undead! Other cabin cards are items, which give the players various benefits and a better chance at survival. The supply of items and weapons is limited, however. Once the cabin deck is exhausted, it is not reshuffled. A separate deck of cards, called event cards, allow the zombies to have their turn. This deck not only brings a variety of zombies into play but each card also has a special effect when drawn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you survive Dead Panic?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150376/dead-winter-crossroads-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.97</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 210</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Horror, Zombies</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area Movement, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Storytelling, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Crossroads&amp;quot; is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors&#39; ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &amp;mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that&#39;s fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group&#39;s goal, but don&#39;t get walked all over by a loudmouth who&#39;s looking out only for his own interests!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It&#39;s a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony&#39;s morale up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169464/defenders-last-stand" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Defenders of the Last Stand</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.28</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Dice, Fighting, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Defenders of The Last Stand is a post apocalyptic adventure game by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Run Fight or Die, Defenders of the Realm) and Jason Maxwell (Agents of SMERSH, Superhero Solitaire) for 1-5 players set in the Western United States more than 50 years after nuclear war. Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand. Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city&#39;s survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of human amazons that ride large mutated beasts, a third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie&#39;s just recently and there weren&#39;t no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &amp;quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&amp;quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It&#39;s a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I&#39;m thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It&#39;s God&#39;s will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I&#39;m hoping we can start again. Me, I&#39;m hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it&#39;s where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don&#39;t know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &amp;ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be, unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We&#39;ll use it carefully. The Last Stand may be our last hope. I don&#39;t know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;--Taken from the Journal of Marha Bourne Star&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65532/defenders-realm" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Defenders of the Realm</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.42</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> &amp;ldquo;Our Liege is in desperate hour!

Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible. As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.&amp;#10; The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick.

Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &amp;#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &amp;#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&amp;mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect.

Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &amp;#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&amp;mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&amp;mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &amp;#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&amp;rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&amp;mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&amp;mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&amp;#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &amp;quot;AP&amp;quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&amp;#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&amp;rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &amp;quot;VP&amp;quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&amp;#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &amp;quot;earth&amp;quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. &amp;#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&amp;mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplemented by&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Dominant Species: The Card Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Dominion Base Set</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.74</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> (from the back of the box:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens.

Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.

By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &amp;mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution. Final scores are for connected taxis and for having least/most pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124548/doom-came-atlantic-city" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Doom that Came to Atlantic City</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.05</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Horror, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Roll / Spin and Move, Trading, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You&#39;re one of the Great Old Ones &amp;ndash; beings of ancient and eldritch power.

Now it&#39;s time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you&#39;re injured twice, you die and are out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you cry like a baby, you don&#39;t draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166280/dragonflame" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">DragonFlame</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.81</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> You are a Dragon.

At any point during his turn, he also has one bonus action, chosen from one of three double-sided cards. After choosing a bonus, the card is turned over, showing a different bonus action. A player may also eat three creatures to increase the number of fireballs he shoots.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a dragon manages to complete a task from one of his Dragonscroll cards, he may add it to his story.

In order to defeat a monster, every player simultaneously plays a power card face-down then reveals the values. If two or more players play the same value, they are all ignored. If players are defeated the player who played the lowest value should return some treasures as a penalty. If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Japanese

In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot; are placed, since &amp;quot;workers&amp;quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards.

The king&#39;s power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king&#39;s region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100423/elder-sign" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Elder Sign</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.01</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Card Game, Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is 1926, and the museum&#39;s extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146021/eldritch-horror" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Eldritch Horror</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &amp;ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators&#39; personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &amp;ndash; or maybe you&#39;ll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &amp;quot;reckoning effect&amp;quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they&#39;re certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163968/elysium" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Elysium</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Mythic Greece.

Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads. Use your initial investment to build track. Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand. Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair&#39;s crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America. Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns. For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train. The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff. Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player&#39;s demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/145928/empire-engine" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Empire Engine</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.13</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Fighting, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Once, the world of Mekannis was united and prospered under the guidance of the Great Engine&amp;mdash;an enormous thinking machine built into the molten heart of the world.

An act of hubris by the world&amp;rsquo;s rulers caused a series of devastating malfunctions that shattered the land and the death of the Great Engine. Now four empires rise to dominance. The Kestrel Dominion, descending from ancient hereditary rulers and cherishing their ancestral tradition of honor; Nova Centralis, a plutocratic nation built upon exploiting wealth and greatly desirous of maintaining their economic edge; the Sylphian Commonwealth, a once-verdant land now poisoned by the aftereffects of the Engine&amp;rsquo;s destruction; and the Grail Prelacy, a theocratic nation emboldened by prophecies of ultimate victory.

Each time a player reaches a new planet, he must decide whether to conquer it and strip the land of its resources, or befriend the natives and obtain their special ability.

There are 19 technologies to research that break the rules and change gameplay. Players must use negotiation and trade, even when it is not their turn, which ensures that there is very little downtime. A random event deck helps build the story of the game, as each round something new happens, usually galaxy-wide.

Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. &amp;#30;The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&amp;#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&amp;#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Th&amp;#30;rough exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#31;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. Th&amp;#31;e game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player&#39;s Politics track. A player&#39;s influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. Once all players have passed, a new round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112686/epic-spell-wars-battle-wizards-duel-mt-skullzfyre" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Epic Spell Wars: Duel at Mt.

In Epic, you take on the role of an elder god, in conflict with other elder gods. The cards in your deck are your champions, who fight for you, and events, which represent your will imposed on the mortal realm. In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards &amp;ndash; each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn &amp;mdash; you don&amp;rsquo;t need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &amp;quot;token&amp;quot; champions. One box supports preconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a &amp;quot;cube&amp;quot; environment for drafting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/88594/eruption" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Eruption</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.44</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The inhabitants of the villages surrounding a dormant volcano were happily living in peace until &amp;mdash; KABOOM! &amp;mdash; the old volcano sprung back to life, unleashing rivers of molten lava in every direction and blasting volcanic rock into the sky. The villages, now faced with destruction, must do whatever they can to protect their homes from the incoming surge of lava.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your village is about to burn up &amp;mdash; can you take the heat?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eruption is a competitive survival game in which each player struggles to save his or her own village from destruction caused by an onslaught of lava from an erupting volcano. As lava enters a village, its temperature increases until it has burned up completely. Players can protect their own villages by placing lava tiles defensively and strategically building walls of various materials to hold back the lava. They are also rewarded with action cards for directing lava to other villages. Action cards allow players to rotate, replace, or remove the hexagonal lava tiles as well as cool down and fortify their own villages. Once the volcano has fully unleashed its fury, the player whose village is at the lowest temperature wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113294/escape-curse-temple" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Escape the Curse of the Temple</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Dice, Electronic, Exploration, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &amp;ndash; the safe room &amp;ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A cursed mask &amp;ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&amp;#10; A golden mask &amp;ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&amp;#10; A red torch or blue key &amp;ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&amp;#10; A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &amp;ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you&#39;re at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren&#39;t back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven&#39;t been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &amp;quot;Treasures&amp;quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &amp;quot;Curses&amp;quot; module, some tiles &amp;quot;curse&amp;quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn&#39;t want to do while escaping a temple!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133848/euphoria-build-better-dystopia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Euphoria</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> UPDATE July 1, 2014: 16 of the original recruit cards have been updated and revised for the second printing of Euphoria. Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they&#39;ve ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Euphorians aren&amp;rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&amp;mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&amp;rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker&#39;s knowledge&amp;mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he&#39;s in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&amp;mdash;especially matching pairs&amp;mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term &amp;quot;dominant species&amp;quot;. At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you&#39;ve evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of prehistoric life.

Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules. The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table. Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players. Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business. Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory. And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting. So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.&amp;quot; - Nature (the world&#39;s most prestigious scientific journal) &amp;#10;Evolution was covered in the journal, Nature.

The Royal Navy gave Franklin two heavy Ships (HMS Terror and HMS Erebus) filled with scientific equipment, 1000 books, a crew of 128 men, and enough food to last for three years. They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August. There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound. Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Their disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail. As leaders of these expeditions in Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin&#39;s fate and succeed where he failed &amp;ndash; by finding the Northwest Passage. Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships. Players acquire victory points by gathering clues, mapping the area, and &amp;ndash; of course &amp;ndash; discovering the Northwest Passage.

If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&amp;#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&amp;#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop&#39;s Mitre.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church&#39;s (i.e. &amp;quot;your&amp;quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&amp;#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &amp;quot;mysteriously&amp;quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &amp;quot;Good Harvest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Good Weather&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Added Taxes&amp;quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &amp;quot;The Plague&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Heavy Rain&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Famine&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Peasant Uprisings&amp;quot;!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent&#39;s villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &amp;quot;f&amp;quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as &#39;add ons.&#39; These items are all still available directly from Academy Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is the most recent edition of Fief.

Some crew and cargo are illegal, and can be confiscated if your ship is boarded by an alliance vessel. Travelling from planet to planet requires turning over &amp;quot;full burn&amp;quot; cards, one for each space moved.

First player to complete the story goals wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Firefly: The Game &amp;ndash; based on the popular Firefly television series created by Joss Whedon &amp;ndash; players captain their own Firefly-class transport ship, traveling the &#39;Verse with a handpicked crew of fighters, mechanics and other travelers. As a captain desperate for work, players are compelled to take on any job &amp;mdash; so long as it pays. Double-dealing employers, heavy-handed Alliance patrols, and marauding Reavers are all in a day&#39;s work for a ship&#39;s captain at the edge of the &#39;Verse. Firefly: The Game is a high-end thematic tabletop boardgame from Gale Force Nine (GF9) and the first in a series of tabletop hobby board games and miniatures games from GF9 set in the Firefly Universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139137/firefly-out-black" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Firefly: Out of the Black</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.82</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play</div><div><b>Description:</b> Firefly: Out to the Black is a quick card game that plays from three to five players. It&amp;rsquo;s unusual in that the players do not compete against each other, but compete against the game. This is a fairly new style of game called a co-op game or cooperative game. Players take on roles of the crew of Serenity and play through a series of Events. Using their Fightin&amp;rsquo;, Flyin&amp;rsquo;, and Thinkin&amp;rsquo; skills they attempt to successfully complete these Events to earn Credits and Honor. If the players run out of Credits or Honor before the end of the game, they all lose and the game wins! If the players manage to complete the predetermined amount of Events without running out of Credits or Honor, they win the game, and live to fly another day!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Double sized Character Cards &amp;ndash; Contains the Character&amp;rsquo;s Skill numbers and special abilities&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Event Cards &amp;ndash; These are the Events the players must overcome to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Serenity Cards &amp;ndash; These are dual use cards. The main use is to help the players overcome Events. It&amp;rsquo;s secondary use is to determine random numbers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alliance Cards &amp;ndash; These are penalty cards that are drawn if the players do not do well at certain Events. Draw too many of these and the players lose the game even if they still have Credits and Honor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gorramit Cards &amp;ndash; These cards modify the Events, generally making them harder.&amp;#10;A Set of Rules &amp;ndash; The rules to the game.&amp;#10;Honor Tokens &amp;ndash; These are used to track the player&amp;rsquo;s Honor.&amp;#10;Credit Tokens &amp;ndash; These are used to track the player&amp;rsquo;s Credits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Character Cards each represent one of the main Characters in Firefly. In addition to having their skills values listed, Each Character has special abilities, which cost a variable amount of Credits or Honor. On a players turn he can choose to spend Credits or Honor on one of these abilities, but it brings them closer to losing, so they need to think about whether they really need to or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A typical turn of the game consists of the active player turning over the top Event card. Each Event card has three challenges, one Fightin&amp;rsquo;, one Flyin&amp;rsquo;, and one Thinkin&amp;rsquo;. Each of these has a number, which the players must equal or exceed to be successful in the challenge. Characters gain skill two different ways, they may play Serenity cards to gain skill, and, after playing their Serenity cards, they add a random number to determine their final skill. This is added to the Character&amp;rsquo;s base skill number listed on their Character cards. Depending on how many challenges they successfully complete they either gain or lose Credits and/or Honor. The more successful the more they gain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the event is resolved, the next player starts a new turn, and turns over the next Event card. The game is over once all the Event cards have been drawn and resolved.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;The Firefly TV show is about surviving with honor. Mal and his crew are continually trying to scrounge up enough credits to keep flying, while maintaining their own personal sense of honor. The game reflects this grand theme with the victory conditions, survive the Event deck without running out of Honor or Credits. Each Event in the deck is tied to an episode in the show, and is easily recognizable by fans of the show. The Skills needed for each Event are tied to action of the episode featured on the card. A sub theme of the show is escaping notice of the Alliance, and again, with the inclusion of the Alliance deck, Firefly: Out to the Black delivers. The Alliance deck is an ever-present threat looming over the players as they desperately seek to finish the Events in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163170/firefly-shiny-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Firefly: Shiny Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.58</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> Firefly: Shiny Dice lasts three rounds, and whoever has the most points after three rounds wins. In each round, each player takes one or more turns. On your first turn in a round, you roll all fifteen dice &amp;mdash; seven crew dice (brown), three passenger dice (white), and five bad guy dice (black) &amp;mdash; then place them in the appropriate places on your display. Crew members and passengers all have unique abilities, some of which involve the option of rerolling dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After any rerolls, you reveal your mission for the round. If you have dice on your board that match the numbers given at the top of the mission, then you&#39;re unaffected by the bold line &amp;mdash; Bushwhacked, Gorram, etc. &amp;mdash; immediately underneath. Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Each Badger die holds one supply die.&amp;#10; Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold.&amp;#10; If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn &amp;mdash; rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice &amp;mdash; or end your turn.

Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the &#39;island&#39;, which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&amp;#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the publisher&#39;s website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175155/forbidden-stars" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Forbidden Stars</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Science Fiction, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &amp;ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board. The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations. In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies. The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because of the game&#39;s three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game&#39;s setup also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game&#39;s four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force&#39;s strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146221/forge-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Forge War</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.58</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Economic, Fantasy, Industry / Manufacturing, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Grid Movement, Role Playing, Variable Phase Order, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Forge War, players will take on the role of blacksmiths in a kingdom rife with marauding harpies, cursed dungeons and fire-breathing dragons.

If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests. Quest management becomes challenging for the player, however, because quests undertaken aren&#39;t completed immediately, but instead progress each turn and become more difficult. At specific time intervals, players will need to add more resources to their quests or face failure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay cycles through three different phases in each round. The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production. The second phase is a market phase that features an action blocking mechanic to gain access to new weapon plans and other advantages.

America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom&#39;s apple pie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction.

For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards.

The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.&amp;#10; Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is no &amp;quot;Alien player&amp;quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.&amp;#10; Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &amp;quot;recalibrates&amp;quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.&amp;#10; The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &amp;quot;alien signals&amp;quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Official FAQ: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/faq.php&amp;#10;Additional Missions: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/mission.php&amp;#10;Galaxy Ball: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/gb-cards.php&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31481/galaxy-trucker" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Galaxy Trucker</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Real-time, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&amp;#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It&#39;s loads of fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won&#39;t know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don&#39;t want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125153/gallerist" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Gallerist</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.13</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Commodity Speculation, Set Collection, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> This age of art and capitalism has created a need for a new occupation - The Gallerist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combining the elements of an Art dealer, museum curator, and Artists&amp;rsquo; manager, you are about to take on that job!

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What&#39;s more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&amp;#10; A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39953/game-thrones-card-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Game of Thrones: Card Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.03</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval, Negotiation, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> This entry is for the Living Card Game (LCG) that was developed from the Collectible Card Game (CCG).

Each card has a train car with a number and also a special power depicted on it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, the player can do one of two things: draw a card from the draw pile and replace one of the cards in his train line with the newly drawn card, or take a face-up card from the middle of the table and use it as a special power. Cards that are replaced from a player&#39;s train line are put in the middle to be used as special powers, and the cards that are used as special powers are discarded. Special powers include such actions as swapping two cards, moving a card, destroying everyone&#39;s cards, and so on.

The game board depicts a garden as a 6x6 grid in which seed and vegetable tiles are placed using dice rolls as coordinates. Players take turns using the dice to plant, water, and harvest five different types of vegetables with differing point values, from the lowly squash to the mighty eggplant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game&#39;s chaining mechanism allows players to water or harvest multiple tiles using a single action, enabling players to build upon each others&#39; chains. Players can also use bird and rabbit tiles to eat other players&#39; seed and veggie tiles, but not without paying a small penalty. Two other special tiles &amp;ndash; the sundial and the scarecrow &amp;ndash; allow players to modify dice rolls or protect their own tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Gnome expansion included in Garden Dice can be added to the base game to give players the ability to adjust the dice rolls for purchasing, watering, and harvesting their vegetables, leading to a more strategic experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bonuses increase the values of tiles as they are harvested, and additional points are awarded at the end of the game for collecting sets.

A door opens &amp;ndash; is someone there? You hear whispers, but no one answers when you call. Your eyes and ears may deceive you, but the hair on your neck tells you what you already know: There are ghosts here &amp;mdash; and not just one for these spirits are legion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Ghost Fightin&#39; Treasure Hunters, a.k.a. Geister, Geister, Schatzsuchmeister!, four intrepid treasure hunters are on a quest, searching for precious hidden jewels, but the phantoms in this house do not give up their bounty easily. As their ghoulish numbers grow, the treasure hunters must work together to acquire all eight jewels and escape the house before it becomes fully haunted or else face their own gruesome demise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players roll dice to determine how many spaces they move this turn and whether a new ghost is added to the board. Players may move up to the number of spaces shown on the die. If they end their movement in a space with a treasure, they may pick it up and place it in their backpack. If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the players must add a third ghost to a room, it transforms into a haunting. A haunting requires at least two people in the room to attempt a fight with it. Players win if they can get all eight treasures and their whole team out of the house; they lose if all six hauntings are on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128537/gentlemen-thieves" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Gentlemen Thieves</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.34</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Gentlemen Thieves is a board game with secret identities, bluffing and theft featuring Ars&amp;egrave;ne Lupin and other characters inspired by author Maurice Leblanc. Whoever ends up with the biggest stack of loot at the end of the game wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game, each player secretly takes one of the five burglar tiles, which come in five different colors; each player also receives 2-4 helping hand tokens. Five locations are set out, each with two randomly chosen equipment tokens next to them; equipment tokens come in five types, with each type appearing in the five colors of the burglars. Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &amp;ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &amp;ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area. Thus, the burglars form provisional teams for the round and are trying to work together to rob a location &amp;ndash; any location! &amp;ndash; but they don&#39;t necessarily know who&#39;s who. On a turn a player either:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Chooses one of the face-up equipment tokens, places it next to a location (with no more than three tokens of the same type being allowed at a location), then reveals a new equipment token.&amp;#10; Draws the top equipment token from the stack, then places it at a location.&amp;#10; Plays a helping hand token to move a special token or add a new special token to a location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as all five types of equipment are at a location, a burglary takes place there. Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place. The car allows someone to move an equipment token to a new location. When the second tunnel is placed next to a location, the two locations with tunnels are now linked and the types of equipment present are considered to be together when determining whether a burglary takes place &amp;ndash; although if the lock is on one of those locations, then nothing can be stolen!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A brigadier token is shuffled into the final six equipment tokens, and when it&#39;s drawn, the game ends immediately. Players then reveal their identities, and the player with the most loot wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30539/get-bit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Get Bit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.25</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Bluffing, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Player Elimination, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> &amp;quot;You don&#39;t have to be faster than the shark, just faster than your friends!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values.

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &amp;ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile&#39;s special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village&#39;s tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128271/ginkgopolis" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ginkgopolis</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.43</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Environmental, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> 2212: Ginkgo Biloba, the oldest and strongest tree in the world, has become the symbol of a new method for building cities in symbiosis with nature.

Exploiting the abilities of the specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings.

Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population. Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents. Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool). Players who don&#39;t follow may &#39;think&#39; to draw more cards. There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards. Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the &#39;black box&#39; edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

In a delicate balance of resource management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune times. Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the Golden Age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points through clever management of your growing mining empire. There are five resources in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each hex contains either two or three resources. Gold generally earns players the most points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less. In addition, each terrain type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of the game. Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains earning slightly fewer points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When gaining new metals and materials, players place them in their &amp;quot;supply track&amp;quot;, a mancala-style track in which you will manage your resources. You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used. Shipping, investments, and Boomtown offices often reward players who fulfill them earlier, so it&#39;s a careful balance of risk and reward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164338/golden-ages" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Golden Ages</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.43</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Modular Board, Tile Placement, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In The Golden Ages, you lead your civilizations through history.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history. Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game&#39;s clever mechanisms can help balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch. The game board is a stylized version of the globe. The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events. Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation. Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events. There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few). Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires. One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn&#39;t gotten one yet. If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch. Then the next player draws and makes his decision. The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws. Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire&#39;s starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by). One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player&#39;s Empire is called.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand. The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire&#39;s actions. If the player&#39;s active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them). A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop). If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire&#39;s starting land with one unit of the Empire&#39;s available troops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer. To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it. Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender&#39;s land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from. In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well. If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense. Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker. In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort. On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land. Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues. Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered). After the active player&#39;s Empire is finished with it&#39;s actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then scoring takes place. Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch. One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land). Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area). These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example). Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player&#39;s color from all Empires controlled that remain on board. Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him. These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then. This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores. The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Online Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160968/homeland-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Homeland: The Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.94</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Memory, Secret Unit Deployment, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Homeland: The Game is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue, deception and hidden agendas.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game&#39;s main mechanism, which can be described as &amp;quot;bag-building&amp;quot;, involves you building a pool of &amp;quot;civilicubes&amp;quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth.

The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power. To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That&#39;s why it is so important to have one&#39;s family members in the right place at the right time &amp;ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one&#39;s goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive).&amp;#10; Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.&amp;#10; Travel to Florence where you&#39;ll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.&amp;#10; Introduce a new family member to the board.&amp;#10; Raise all lying family members on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the &amp;quot;Power of the Medici&amp;quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles. Certain actions require you to remove such a tile, and the game ends when they&#39;re all gone. Players then sum their power points &amp;ndash; earned for gained tiles and majorities in the regions and Florence &amp;ndash; for a final scoring, and the player with the most power wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/859/illuminati" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Illuminati</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.20</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1982</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Novel-based, Political</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Illuminati is a classic Steve Jackson (I) game of world domination. Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player&#39;s turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player&#39;s illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &amp;quot;megabucks&amp;quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 1&amp;#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 2&amp;#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 3&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-published as:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Illuminati: Deluxe Edition&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CCG Version:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Illuminati: New World Order&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magazine Articles:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&amp;#10; European Illuminati - New cards.&amp;#10; &amp;#10; The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&amp;#10; Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&amp;#10; &amp;#10; Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&amp;#10; Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191862/imhotep" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Imhotep</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.09</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Modular Board</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Imhotep, the players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card.

Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To set up the game board, place the central hex tile, then add five green gems and one indigo gem to it. Place six &amp;quot;U-turn&amp;quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &amp;quot;moves&amp;quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem. If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve. Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green, and 1 for yellow. The player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9674/ingenious" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ingenious</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.20</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Pattern Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player&#39;s score is equal to her worst-scoring color, not her best, so she needs to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from her rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, she scores one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, she immediately takes another turn. At the end of her turn, she refills her rack to six tiles. (Before refilling her rack, if she has no tiles on it that contain hexes in her lowest-scoring color, she can discard all of her tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see his partner&#39;s tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/466/inkognito" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Inkognito</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.61</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1988</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Point to Point Movement, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don&#39;t know which mission they must fulfill!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players&#39; figures or the Ambassador. When&amp;#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &amp;quot;ask questions&amp;quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The &amp;#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador&#39;s player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &amp;quot;perfect knowledge&amp;quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Innovation</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.27</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Civilization</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> This game by Carl Chudyk is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times.

Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end, the player with the best kingdom &amp;mdash; and not the richest player &amp;mdash; becomes the sovereign of the island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148949/istanbul" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Istanbul</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> There&#39;s hustle and bustle at Istanbul&#39;s grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action.

Depending on the value rolled he must then place that die on a placement card that is less than or equal to that value. Since there can only be one die per placement there is a possibility that he will be unable to place his die due to another player being there or that space being patrolled by a guard, if that is the case he will temporarily lose that die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Step 2: Take Action on Placement Card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After landing on a placement card the player then takes the action associated with that card. Some placements will allow you to collect materials while others let you steal from other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Step 3: Use Material Cards to Craft Items&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Anytime during a players turn they may take two material cards to create a crafted item. Each crafted item has a special ability which helps throughout the game. Some crafted items will alter dice rolls while others make it easier to escape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Step 4: Gather the Items for an Escape Plan&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There will be a handful of escape plans that are available for everyone to utilize.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&amp;#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &amp;quot;colleagues&amp;quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance of the &amp;quot;good old days,&amp;quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player&#39;s ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &amp;quot;holds&amp;quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &amp;quot;captain,&amp;quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and which to the &amp;quot;night.&amp;quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; - and one on the right (&amp;quot;night&amp;quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain&#39;s. When it is a player&#39;s turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice. Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &amp;quot;combat&amp;quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &amp;quot;gunpowder&amp;quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18946/just-desserts" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Just Desserts</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.21</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 25 - 25</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> The guests are here, and they&#39;re hungry, so try to be the best waiter at this caf&amp;eacute; by making sure that all the guests get their Just Desserts!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this card game, each player starts with a hand of three dessert cards while three guest cards are placed in the center of the table; each dessert card shows 1-3 tastes that it satisfies, such as chocolate, fruit, or pastry, while the guest cards show what they crave as well as what they refuse to eat.

Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. &amp;#10;You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes.

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &amp;mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &amp;mdash; failure &amp;mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts.

Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn&#39;t wait for you or for mistakes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;mean&amp;quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.&amp;#10; Two independent player-influenced game timers &amp;mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &amp;mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.&amp;#10; A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.&amp;#10; A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.&amp;#10; Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time.

Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it&#39;s better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &amp;#10;&amp;#10; Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&amp;#10; Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &amp;#10; One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &amp;#10; Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high.

During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles.

Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board. One point is scored for each field tile in the player&#39;s largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board. The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile. Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles. When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action. Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands. There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry. On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters. The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player&#39;s store. On their turn the other players may match the store owner&#39;s bid in both the number and type of crop counters. If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner. If no other player has matched the store owner&#39;s bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile. It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile. A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile. If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile. However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker&#39;s ability again. Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have two actions per turn. There are four possible actions. Each action can only be performed once per turn. As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b). Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d). A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag. The bag also contains a number of event tiles. The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile. When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game. No points are awarded for ties. Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board. The player with the most points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122515/keyflower" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Keyflower</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.98</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Economic, Nautical, Renaissance, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Memory, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver, Route/Network Building, Set Collection, Tile Placement, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player&#39;s own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players&#39; villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &amp;quot;Key&amp;quot; series from R&amp;amp;D Games set in the medieval &amp;quot;Key&amp;quot; land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257/kill-doctor-lucky" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Kill Doctor Lucky Board Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1996</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Murder/Mystery</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Point to Point Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In this notorious game, an inversion of Clue, you hate Doctor Lucky.

As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &amp;quot;Fame&amp;quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">King of Tokyo</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.34</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&amp;mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack.

The idea is simple. They select warriors of all ages and lands and whisk them away to the Hormonde where the enslaved gladiators must fight for their souls and the chance to become the ultimate champion. Why don&#39;t the gods put an end to this macabre circus? Why does Xelor himself turn a blind eye to the demons&#39; meddling with time&#39;s delicate web? Well, you may ask, but it is not for us mortals to know the minds of the gods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Krosmaster: Arena is a player-vs-player, tactical card game with anime-style miniatures that offers the craftiest tacticians among you the chance to challenge other players to heated battles in arenas scattered around Hormonde. All players build their team using a pre-determined method, whether a point system, draft, or at random. Equip your team with spells, weapons and other items adapted to their requirements, then utilize their various talents and abilities to create a powerful fighting force. Every figure has a point value attached to it to help balance things out. Randomly drawn event cards spice up the game at each turn, and the winning conditions differ for each game based on the scenario you choose to play. Only those who are able to create a strong, yet versatile, strategy will prevail!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="L"><div>L</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136280/la-boca" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">La Boca</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.03</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Pattern Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> La Boca, the most famous neighborhood in the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires, was populated by many Italian immigrants when first founded.

In shifting teams of two that sit across from one another, players try to create skylines on challenge cards &amp;ndash; but the players can see the completed image only from their point of view, so they must consult with one another constantly to make sure each colored block ends up in the right location while racing against the timer.

Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &amp;mdash; and, of course, score points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player&#39;s scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don&#39;t have an animal of that tpe you don&#39;t get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1218/junior-labyrinth" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Labyrinth</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.68</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1995</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Children&#39;s Game, Fantasy, Maze, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Modular Board, Pattern Building, Pattern Recognition, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Junior Labyrinth, the beginner&#39;s version of Labyrinth and part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, is a maze like no other with twelve different treasures waiting to be found within the paths of the labyrinth, which shift with every turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thankfully, the players have some control over how the labyrinth walls move.

The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&amp;rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon&#39;s destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy&#39;s reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site&#39;s energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player&#39;s supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96913/lancaster" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Lancaster</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Voting, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the designer of Glen More comes a new title published by Queen Games: Lancaster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1413, the new king of England, Henry V of Lancaster, has ambitious plans: The unification of England and the conquest of the French crown!

At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round.

As a wealthy, well-educated aristocrat, you have travelled the world and had the fortune to enjoy your life to the fullest &amp;ndash; but you see that history is about to change course and you know that in order to stay strong, your family must prepare well. You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy enables you to build a powerful dynasty in 18th century France as you step into the shoes of a French noble and compete for lasting honor. Over three generations, you &amp;ndash; a resourceful patriarch or matriarch &amp;ndash; will attempt to create a lasting legacy by establishing a house with ties to many different wealthy and powerful families from France and abroad (Spain, Italy, Russia and other countries).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This card game offers endless possibilities. Each time you build a family, you write a unique story, bringing to life the diverse relationships between parents and their children, between cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility &amp;ndash; you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy &amp;ndash; known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 &amp;ndash; you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine &amp;quot;contribution to the family&amp;quot; cards. This all culminates in a highly thematic card game that will satisfy players who enjoy exploring many different paths to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Legacy is a worker placement game in which you take actions to improve the standing and/or wealth of your family. You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three &#39;currencies&#39; in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three &#39;currencies&#39; detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146652/legendary-encounters-alien-deck-building-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Legendary: Encounters</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Horror, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Co-operative Play, Deck / Pool Building, Player Elimination, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game, based on the four movies of the Alien series, is a fully cooperative game with original art.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain&#39;s attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain&#39;s particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &amp;ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &amp;ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what&#39;s available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player&#39;s turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &amp;quot;master strike&amp;quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game&#39;s end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &amp;ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &amp;ndash; then the players all lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156689/legendary-villains-marvel-deck-building-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Legendary: Villans</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.83</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Comic Book / Strip</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Deck / Pool Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Legendary universe gets flipped upside down in Legendary: Villains &amp;ndash; Marvel Deck Building Game, and you can now play as villains trying to take out the heroes protecting the city!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game remains roughly the same as in the first Legendary game as players can work both with and against other players to overcome obstacles that the game throws at them.

As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;How to Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish. The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Design Notes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence. The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion. During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last. Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage. Lords of Scotland scales well to the number of players with most victories being determined in the final skirmish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20437/lords-vegas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Lords of Vegas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Dice Rolling, Tile Placement, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> You and your opponents represent powerful developers in a burgeoning Nevada city.

Put your dollars on the line . . . it&#39;s time to roll!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is broken into 8 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty &#39;lots&#39;. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot&#39;s space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino&#39;s boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and VP. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. VP goes only to the casino&#39;s owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents&#39; casinos to make more money.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&amp;#10; Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Keltis entry:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it&#39;s better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&amp;#10; Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&amp;#10; One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&amp;#10; Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&amp;#10; 5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&amp;#10; All this is added to the points scored during the game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158340/lost-legacy-flying-garden" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Lost Legacy: Flying Garden</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.90</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Memory, Player Elimination</div><div><b>Description:</b> Lost Legacy: Flying Garden is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&amp;ndash;4 players.

It&#39;s about the grueling journey: traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads, through severe weather, and ever-dwindling resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the course of the game, players must explore the ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As you set out from the outfitters with everything you own strapped to your back, you must balance carefully the resources that you need. Of course you will need tools, dynamite and timber to extract mountain gold, but you&#39;ll need to make sure you have room for food, rifles and fishing poles to help you survive in the wilderness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Grab your horse, your pack, and your whiskey because &amp;quot;The Gold Fever is Raging&amp;quot; in the Yukon.

Each player wants to develop the city on his own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than his rivals. On his turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, he gets the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs).

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &amp;ldquo;laboratory&amp;rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.&amp;#10;Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&amp;rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?&amp;#10;Beware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large&amp;hellip;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96848/mage-knight-board-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Mage Knight</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 150 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Co-operative Play, Deck / Pool Building, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Role Playing, Tile Placement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Mage Knight board game puts you in control of one of four powerful Mage Knights as you explore (and conquer) a corner of the Mage Knight universe under the control of the Atlantean Empire.

Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Building a hut requires that the space&#39;s landscape is &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &amp;quot;ritual sites&amp;quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &amp;quot;active landscapes&amp;quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &amp;mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &amp;mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &amp;mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63628/manhattan-project" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Manhattan Project</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.52</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Economic, Fighting, Industry / Manufacturing, Negotiation, World War II</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the back of the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Global Power Struggle Begins&amp;#10;Which nation will take the lead and become world&#39;s dominant superpower?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Manhattan Project makes you the leader of a great nation&#39;s atomic weapons program in a deadly race to build bigger and better bombs.

Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg. A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master. If you win, you&#39;ll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you&#39;d like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour. If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate. How many of the three boats will make it and which ones? Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control? Manila is a fun family game that takes minutes to learn and brings the river boats of the Philippines to life!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83330/mansions-madness" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Mansions of Madness</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.44</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Miniatures, Murder/Mystery, Puzzle</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Modular Board, Partnerships, Pick-up and Deliver, Role Playing, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Publisher Description, from &amp;#10;http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=136&amp;amp;esem=2&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts.

The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible. Players start with a number of trains ringing the board. Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.

During the Metabolism Phase, the player must choose to pay food or take damage to fuel their turn&#39;s activity. The Drift Phase involves randomly determining where to place food, toxins, and special particles on the game board available for all players to consume. The Action Phase allows players to choose one action: Hunting &amp;amp; Gathering (includes moving, eating, and attacking), Evolving, Mutating, OR Subdividing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Evolving costs a player 3 food, but allows them to draw an evolution card at random which grants their microbe(s) abilities, possibly to move further, attack harder, and/or have some other unique ability. Mutating costs a player 4 food (and one evolution - if any), but it increases the total number of evolution cards a player can have in play, the base movement, and the base damage of the player&#39;s microbe(s). Mutation also allows some damage to be healed. Subdividing costs a player 5 food per subdivision, but each subdivision creates a new microbe on the board for the player, allowing them alternate start locations each turn, an extra life should a microbe be destroyed, and moves the player closer to a win condition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117914/milestones" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Milestones</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Route/Network Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The settlement of the country is the work of the players in their role as noble builders in Milestones!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, players work together to build roads, create marketplaces, and erect houses.

Probes have been sent to Mars, and soon astronauts will be manning rockets in order to mine the planet for newly discovered resources. The first is a brand new element, Celerium, that could prove to be a combustible energy source the likes man has never seen. The second is Sylvanite, an incredibly dense material unlike anything found on earth. In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet. Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From Bruno Faidutti&#39;s website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme. We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmod&amp;#195;&amp;#169;e. In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet. For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, &amp;agrave; la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet. Nothing really new here, but there was much work on it and we&#39;re really proud of the result.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118/modern-art" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Modern Art</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1992</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Commodity Speculation, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Buying and selling paintings is a very lucrative business, at least that&#39;s what Hollywood&#39;s led us to believe, and that&#39;s the premise of this game.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players &#39;kicks down the door&#39; - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &amp;quot;bad stuff&amp;quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Zombies from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Zombies 2: Armed and Dangerous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163056/musee" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Musee</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Pattern Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Mus&amp;eacute;e is a 30-minute card-laying game for 2-4 players.

After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what&#39;s going on inside his colony &amp;ndash; that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they&#39;ve developed the ant colony).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn&#39;t tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can&#39;t. Whoever has the most points after three years wins.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&amp;eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn&#39;t keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &amp;mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &amp;mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5942/mystery-rummy-al-capone-and-chicago-underworld" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Mystery Rummy: Al Capone and the Chicago Underworld</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.88</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2003</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Mafia</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Mystery Rummy: Al Capone and the Chicago Underworld, the fourth title in the Mystery Rummy series, introduces some elements of Canasta with players scoring bonuses for collecting complete sets.

Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players&#39; avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party&#39;s endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story.

Each mythology includes two pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player in Myths at War needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each expansion increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory but all expansions can be played on his own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&amp;rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="N"><div>N</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126042/nations" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Nations</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.81</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 200</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Civilization, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&amp;ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay introduction&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Buy a card&amp;#10; Deploy a worker&amp;#10; Hire an architect for a wonder&amp;#10; Special action provided by a card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game.

(Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a twist to the game, though &amp;ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time.

Players place tiles strategically to a shared game board to cut timber, quarry stone, plant fields of wheat, and fill pastures with fat sheep. Players then use these resources to erect buildings on their own village boards, attempting to complete rows and columns for population points. Whoever can build the biggest and most prosperous town will end up with the biggest population and win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New Haven is a tile-laying game with a drafting component. The center board is the land between the player villages from which resources will be gathered. Players select from their two hidden tiles and play on this board to generate available value in some of the four resources. Once per game, each player can get a shipment which delivers a large value of one specific resource type.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This value is then used by the player to play building tokens on his personal village board. However, he can play only building tokens already owned behind his player screen, with restrictions on how buildings must be arranged. He can elect to play a token face down for more flexibility, but this means a lower score if he successfully completes that row or column of buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player is done building, any value he hasn&#39;t used is available for his opponents to use to build! Thus, the goal when placing resource tiles is to generate just enough for what is needed, not the most that can possibly be created. Finally, the player drafts new building tokens for use on future turns; plan your creation and consumption of resources to perfectly match your needs, and you&#39;ll be rewarded with additional tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base game lasts ten turns, and the player who attracts the most colonists to his village by completing roads and avenues of buildings wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New Haven plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players, lasting about 15 minutes per player, with a bit more time needed for learning games. The game includes a side B game board with some twists, as well as rule variants that can make the gameplay either more forgiving or more strategic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/114667/new-science" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">New Science</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.57</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Educational, Industry / Manufacturing, Renaissance</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area Control / Area Influence, Dice Rolling, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players control one of the great scientists during the 17th century Scientific Revolution in Europe.

The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So!&#39; to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra. Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&amp;#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&amp;#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&amp;#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation. There are six &amp;#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game. Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue. Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen). The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board. A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks. If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost. However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on. After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card. The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Al Capone A description of this version:&amp;#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other versions/re-themes:&amp;#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game.

People fear for their existence, while scientists struggle to explain the phenomenon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Until they came.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The creatures of nightmare &amp;mdash; vampires, werewolves, and ghouls &amp;mdash; have begun to appear throughout the world, and they show no sign of hesitation in claiming the dark world as their own!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;--&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher Blurb&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group. Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&amp;rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nightfall&#39;s base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Integrates with:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Nightfall: Martial Law&amp;#10; Nightfall: Blood Country&amp;#10; Nightfall: The Coldest War&amp;#10; Nightfall: Dark Rages&amp;#10; Nightfall: Eastern Skies&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176565/ninja-camp" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ninja Camp</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2016</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Goooood morning, campers!

The Empire sends emissaries to foreign nations, brings technicians and scholars from the west, builds a network of railroads, and achieves an outstandingly fast industrial revolution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The nation and Emperor count on the support of the Great Four, the big conglomerates that emerge with great power and massive control over the Japanese economy. They are called Zaibatsu, and their influence on the Meiji Emperor and importance on the fate of Japan is incredibly high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nippon is an Area Majority Game in which players control Zaibatsu and try to develop their web of power by investing in new industries, improving their technological knowledge, shipping goods to foreign countries or using them to satisfy local needs, and growing their influence and power as they oversee the era of rapid industrialization of Japan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The foundations of the big Zaibatsu were the traditional silk workshops, but soon the conglomerates diversified their influence and power, building a complex structure of interconnected companies that made them giant players in the world&amp;rsquo;s new industrial era. Each player takes the reins of one of these big corporations and tries to develop it in order to grow and achieve power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game, players must carefully choose which types of industry to invest in to get the most influence over the Japanese islands. Every action that is taken helps to forge their own path to new opportunities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nippon is a fast-paced economic game with challenging decisions, set during an important time in Japanese history, and when a new great nation is born.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">No Thanks!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are simple.

The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value. Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors. Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but a 2011 edition supports up to seven.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was originally published in Germany by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!. Amigo&#39;s international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English.

But the most feared weapon of all needs no human guidance. It&#39;s a giant cybernetic tank called the OGRE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic OGRE game gives one player a force of infantry and armor, and a command post he must defend. The other player has only one unit - but it&#39;s an OGRE. It&#39;s an even match.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it&#39;s just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &amp;quot;do you develop your grain productivity &amp;ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &amp;ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won&#39;t get much?&amp;quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all the priests have been used, there&#39;s a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176361/one-night-revolution" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">One Night Revolution</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Science Fiction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> One Night Revolution (formerly One Night Resistance) is a super fast game of secret identities for 3 to 10 players that combines all the deductive and chaotically fun elements of the One Night Ultimate Werewolf series with more structured game play.

Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you&#39;ve placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player&#39;s buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he&#39;ll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165477/orcs-orcs-orcs" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Orcs Orcs Orcs</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Deck / Pool Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Orcs Orcs Orcs is a game for two to four players that combines two excellent game mechanics that have not been paired before (deck building and tower defense) and has players casting spells, squashing orcs and rolling up the score in the Orc Squash Tournament.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mages start the game on top of the tower in the middle of the battlefield. The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower.

Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the wake of the Canal&amp;rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&amp;mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&amp;oacute;n Free Trade Zone.

If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157789/pandemic-contagion" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pandemic: Contagion</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.56</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Medical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> After many years of trying to defeat the diseases that threaten mankind&amp;rsquo;s existence, the tables have been turned. You are now the disease and guess what? There is no cure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Pandemic: Contagion, you are competing against other diseases (fellow players) to see who can eliminate humanity. With no cure to be had, the one of you that wipes out all human civilization will come out on top as the most deadly disease ever known to man, may he rest in peace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic: Contagion includes a deck of contagion cards with differing colored borders, city cards with similar colored borders, event/WHO cards, player disease card and disease cubes. On a turn you take two of three possible actions, and you can take the same action twice. Those actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Draw contagion cards equal to your current incubation rate.&amp;#10; Advance one of three mutations to the next level.&amp;#10; Spread disease equal to your current transmission rate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the number of diseases equals the city&amp;rsquo;s population number, the city is wiped out. The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number. The two smaller numbers are awarded to those with the second- and third-most diseases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your disease card has three mutations: Incubation (number of cards you can draw), Transmission (number of disease cubes you can spread), and Resistance (number of cubes/cards you can protect). As an action, you can advance a mutation one level by discarding the required number of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Event cards are drawn at the start of each round and affect everyone during their turn. You might benefit from the card or it could have a negative impact. WHO cards are always bad, but your resistance will lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level, if you planned ahead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mid-game scoring occurs when the second, fourth and sixth skull comes out. When a city icon appears, a new city is introduced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pandemic: Legacy Season 1</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Environmental, Medical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Set Collection, Trading, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player&#39;s turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month&#39;s objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it&#39;s no longer available for play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150658/pandemic-cure" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pandemic: The Cure</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.44</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Medical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it&#39;s up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world&#39;s hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &amp;mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each turn, new &amp;quot;infection dice&amp;quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104581/panic-wall-street" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Panic on Wall Street!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.02</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 11</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Negotiation, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Commodity Speculation, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Stock Holding</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Panic on Wall Street! you take on the role of a freewheeling capitalist out to outmaneuver your competitors and earn your place as a great industrialist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are divided into managers and investors.

For the ghosts, the goal is to inflict at least &amp;pound;45,000 of damage (in tribute to Special 45 &amp;ndash; Old Faydhutee Single Malt) on the manor, whether it is inflicted by the ghosts or the hunters. The ghost hunters want to stop the ghosts before they achieve their objective.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The dual-level game board represents a manor floor composed of 36 rooms, with each room being a tile representing a value from &amp;pound;1,000 to &amp;pound;6,000; each of the four ghosts corresponds to a room type and will hide beneath a tile of this type, starting its devastation of the hotel by removing tiles adjacent to the one it&#39;s hidden beneath. The ghost hunters must try to determine where the ghosts are hiding based upon the tiles destroyed. While doing this, though, the ghost hunters will also remove tiles &amp;ndash; thus destroying them and adding to the total damage &amp;ndash; to see whether a ghost is hidden beneath.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ghost hunters must think carefully and logically over which tiles to remove while the ghosts have to use cunning and psychology in order to cloud their investigation and remain concealed.

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player&#39;s stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can&#39;t change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &amp;ndash; and you&#39;re not required to do either &amp;ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &amp;ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What&#39;s more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn&#39;t give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round.

Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral&#39;s construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points. Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points. Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game. Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points. Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen. Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; The Pillars of the Earth Expansion Set (which include the Expansion Cards in some editions)&amp;#10; The Pillars of the Earth: Expansion Cards (which are included in the Expansion Set in some editions)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2987/pirates-cove" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pirate&#39;s Cove</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.60</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2002</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fighting, Nautical, Pirates</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Pick-up and Deliver, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Come aboard and sail to Pirate&#39;s Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers. The tales of those legendary pirates of old who&#39;ve fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter&#39;s storm, you set sail to Pirate&#39;s Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate&#39;s Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each island (except Pirate&#39;s Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &amp;quot;tall tales&amp;quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &amp;quot;pirate&amp;quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate&#39;s Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172560/piratoons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Piratoons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.70</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Nautical, Pirates, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Build the biggest, baddest, best Pirate ship on the high seas. Plunder your way to glory and fame!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Piratoons, each turns begins with a treasure of boat parts and equipment being revealed. All at the same time, each Pirate rushes to allocate crew in an effort to plunder the best loot by placing their crew meeples on individual items as bids. Each piece of treasure goes to the player with the most crew invested in the item, but only after removing all tied bids. Therefore, Pirates need to stay alert for sneaky opportunities to cancel out an opponent&#39;s efforts or for chances to swoop in and steal a disputed treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The unclaimed loot is auctioned off with doubloons earned by your crew and then the ship construction begins. Pirates score points for having the most money or equipment, or having the fastest, best, or largest ship. Sets of tiles and unfilled boat sections also add and subtract from your score. The player with the most points after eight rounds is the most notorious Pirate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A featured component of the game is the central loot chest formed by two double-sided boards with raised edges. Before each turn this treasure chest gets loaded with random face-down treasure, then it&#39;s sealed, flipped, and revealed simultaneously to the eager Pirates by removing the board on top. The mad rush of plundering in real-time (there is a 15-second sand timer included) and the spatial puzzle to build the best ship possible are the key ingredients of the game&#39;s experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.42</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1903</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Economic, Farming, Party Game, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> The original game was invented by Harry E.

There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round. When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves. If you&#39;re successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, &amp;quot;Corner on wheat!&amp;quot; (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others.

The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&amp;rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&amp;rsquo;s rating for the current &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;. There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched. These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations. So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&amp;hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each player&amp;rsquo;s turn they draw an event card.

These tokens can later be used to help with tasks. However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances. The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for. If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.

Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &amp;ndash; along with a little luck &amp;ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent&#39;s piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the second eruption, the game changes.

Founded in the times of Caesar Augustus and built up by generations of Roman architects, this was the Emperor&#39;s residence and a world city during this period. The remains of these most impressive structures can still be visited today. Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive &amp;quot;Porta Nigra&amp;quot;, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game Porta Nigra (which translates as &amp;quot;black gate&amp;quot;) is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Buildings are erected physically at the various locations around the city using 3D building pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180906/portal-morth" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Portal of Morth</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Take That, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Portal of Morth is a competitive board game inspired in tower defense video games. During the game, the players will have a team of heroes with which they will fight against an ever increasing amount of powerful enemies. As a general rule, the game will have a duration of five rounds, with one wave per player each round. Each wave is divided in four phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Lord Morth&amp;rsquo;s phase: The starting player rolls the enemy dice into the portal board, to determine in what path will the enemies enter the boards. For this, the player will roll as many enemy dice as indicated on the turn track, and a 12 faced die to determine the exact position of the portal. Also, the players will receive cards to trump their opponent&amp;rsquo;s strategies.&amp;#10;2. Portal phase: During this phase, the players may pay gold to turn the portal, modifying the initial enemy distribution. In turn&amp;rsquo;s order, each player may pay as much gold as they want to move the portal in any direction. Once all the players have moved the portal, or have passed their turn, they will take the enemy dice that ended the phase in their zones of the portal board, locating them in the corresponding paths.&amp;#10;3. Heroes&amp;rsquo; phase: It&amp;rsquo;s the heroes&amp;rsquo; turn. During this phase, the players will move and attack with their team of characters, trying to eliminate all threats from their boards.&amp;#10;4. Assault phase: The last phase of each wave, during which the enemies will advance trying to exit the player&amp;rsquo;s boards. The starting player will roll a 3 faced dice, and each player will have to add the resulting number to the initial movement value of each enemy. If an enemy escapes a player&amp;rsquo;s board, the player will take damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all rounds are finished, the game ends. The winner is the player who has the fewest damage points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171835/posthuman" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Posthuman</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Dice, Exploration, Fighting, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Partnerships, Role Playing, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Our aspiration to omnipotence has led to the enhancement of our capacities so far beyond our species&#39; limits that we created our genetic successors.

Caesar Hadrian is no longer waging war against the barbarians, but building cities and fortifications to ensure a lengthy domination of the Roman culture and wealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The southern part of Britain is under Roman domination, and Caesar has already begun the construction of Hadrian&#39;s Wall to protect the empire from invasions from the North. Together with the wall, Caesar has ordered the founding of a new city that will remind the locals of the glory of Rome. He has appointed five of his most trusted men to take resources and workers from Rome and to build the city together &amp;ndash; but in the end only one of them will be appointed Praetor and rule the Province in the name of Caesar.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Praetor, you will take the role of a Roman engineer, and you will work together with the other players to build a magnificent city. You will manage your limited resources wisely and look for new ones, you will recruit new Workers while your old experienced ones will retire, you will build settlements to keep the population happy, and you will praise the Gods to earn their favor. Caesar will reward you if you give away precious resources to build Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Wall, thus increasing your chances of becoming Praetor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every turn, you will place your Workers on previously built City Tiles to gain resources, Morale, new Workers, or Favor points. You may also assign Workers to build new City Tiles or spend resources to meet Caesar&amp;rsquo;s demands to gain Favor Points. At the end of each turn, you will have to pay your Workers. Otherwise, the mood in the city will deteriorate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most of the actions your Workers will perform will help them gain experience. They will become increasingly skilled in collecting resources. Your most experienced Workers will eventually retire and bring you additional Favor Points, but you will still have to show solidarity and pay them until the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/152174/pressure-cooker" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Pressure Cooker</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.33</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Recognition, Pick-up and Deliver, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Pressure Cooker is a real-time game where players take on the roles of chefs vying for the right to become the new Head Chef at the city&#39;s hottest new restaurant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Played over three rounds, players must quickly and accurately work to collect and combine the needed ingredients to fill all of the orders that have been placed throughout the restaurant.

For each card played you will place its own &amp;quot;Producer&amp;quot; (worker) to activate areas on your dashboard (the studios) or different locations on the main scoreboard that represent Hollywood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can buy scripts, engage the biggest movie star of the time, young players with a great future and legendary directors. At the time of producing each film, it will extract from a pool of tokens representing the potential audience for that year and the choice of which films produce must be made according to specific strategies to meet the latent demand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the production of the film will procure players the money to expand own activities, the award ceremony at the end of each year will give them the necessary points for the win, making the economic aspect important but not relevant to the final score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the third year in the base game (or in the case of the fifth game to experts), it will award bonuses and the Reckoning will be to determine the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every aspect of the game: dynamic production, events, characters, scripts, have been played so historical in order to give movie fans a reproduction as faithful as possible of Hollywood of the 1940s. Every script and character shows in addition to game information, rumors, gossip and curiosity that will delight even the players less competitive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140717/progress-evolution-technology" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Progress: Evolution of Technology</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.70</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Civilization</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Card Drafting, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Progress: Evolution of Technology is a card game about researching technologies. Each player takes his civilization from early antiquity and learns various technologies, moving progressively to the Middle Ages, the Industrial Revolution, and Modern Times and ending with today&#39;s Internet or Social Welfare.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unlike other civilization games, Progress focuses on a single aspect of civilization building: researching technologies that help a society advance. The 210 technology cards in the game are divided into three ages (Ancient, Middle Ages, Industrial) and three types (Military, Science and Culture). With every advancement on a path, you gain easier access to its more advanced technologies and you&#39;ll end up opening the door to the next age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each tech card provides one bonus, which can vary from one extra knowledge to a larger hand size. Even though most tech cards in the game come in multiple copies (usually one per player), the key technologies occur less frequently, forcing players to specialize and granting them unique advantages. Every technology you research decreases the cost of up to three more advanced technologies, accelerating the race towards the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game play is streamlined, with players usually taking two actions, thus making each turn short and ensuring that you use the time when the others are playing for planning rather than seeing it as downtime.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/145203/prosperity" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Prosperity</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.81</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Environmental</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> You&#39;re the leader of a great nation which is currently expanding. Over the course of the seven decades covered by the game, you will have to invest in infrastructures and industries, provide your country with energy and finance the mercurial forces of research in order to remain competitive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But prosperity has a price. You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &amp;ndash; energy and ecology &amp;ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &amp;ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &amp;ndash; is set up during the playing area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Energy &amp;ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&amp;#10; Ecology &amp;ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&amp;#10; Capital &amp;ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&amp;#10; Research &amp;ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&amp;#10; Prosperity &amp;ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn&#39;t maxed out&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Take money.&amp;#10; Remove one pollution marker.&amp;#10; Move forward one space on one research track.&amp;#10; Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &amp;euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &amp;euro;100, plus &amp;euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &amp;euro;50.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you&#39;ll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &amp;quot;Trader&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &amp;quot;governor&amp;quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &amp;quot;large buildings.&amp;quot; Each player&#39;s accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67928/puzzle-strike" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Puzzle Strike: Bag of Chips</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy, Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management, Player Elimination, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Puzzle Strike: Bag of Chips is all that and a bag of chips!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Puzzle Strike is a card game played with cardboard chips instead of cards that simulates a puzzle video game called puzzle fighter that, in-turn, simulates the fighting game street fighter that is emulated in puzzle fighter&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand any of that, that&amp;rsquo;s ok!

Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that&#39;s as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player&#39;s 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can&#39;t place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round. After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After four rounds, the game ends. Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score.

Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You&#39;re not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/115098/quarriors-quarmageddon" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Quarmageddon</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Expansion for Base-game, Fantasy, Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Deck / Pool Building, Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Qua-Boom!

Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it&#39;s to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that&#39;s the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you&#39;re the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="R"><div>R</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ra</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1999</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Press Your Luck, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns). Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three &amp;quot;epochs&amp;quot; (rounds). The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Box:&amp;#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&amp;#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

Pharaohs, The Nile, Civilizations, and Monuments as well as the occasional catastrophe are all here.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Instead of auctions, the core mechanism of Ra, each player rolls 5 dice and can reroll any of them up to two times. The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg. a player can&#39;t claim purple civilization square with a green die). Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.) or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch. One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side.&amp;#10;Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain. Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the box: Remember Ra! Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way. Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll. True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when &amp;quot;Ra&amp;quot; shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 1 game board, 92 wooden cubes, 5 dice, 1 Ra figure, 4 summary cards, rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Race for the Galaxy</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Civilization, Economic, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments.

As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. Players will need to assemble a crew, collect provisions and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. There is glory to be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie. So gather your warriors, it&amp;rsquo;s raiding season!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Aim of the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of Raiders of the North Sea is to impress the Chieftain by having the most Victory Points (VP) at the game&amp;rsquo;s end. Victory Points are gained primarily by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and making Offerings to the Chieftain. How players use their Plunder is also vital to their success. The game ends when either only 1 Fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie are removed, or all Offerings have been made.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Gameplay Overview&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Proceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes his turn in full. On his turn, a player may choose to Work or Raid. Players continue to take turns until 1 of the 3 end-game conditions has been met. Regardless of choices, each turn follows the same pattern:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Place Worker and resolve its action&amp;#10;2. Pick up a different Worker and resolve its action&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Working&amp;#10;Having a good Crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding. So before making any raids, players will need to do some work to prepare their Crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the Village, at the bottom of the board. There are 8 different buildings, with various actions. Players must first place their one and only Worker in an available building (where there is no Worker present), before picking up a different Worker from a different building (where there is a Worker present).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Raiding&amp;#10;Once players have hired enough Crew and collected Provisions, they may choose to raid on their turn. To raid a Settlement (Harbour, Outpost, Monastery or Fortress), players need to meet 3 requirements. They must have:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. A large enough Crew.&amp;#10;2. Enough Provisions (and Gold for Monasteries/Fortresses).&amp;#10;3. The required Worker colour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Raiding offers various ways of scoring (Military Strength, Plunder, Valkyrie, etc.). This is also how Grey and White Workers enter the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;End of the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 3 ways the game can end:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. There is only 1 set of Plunder left in the Fortresses (1 of the 6 Fortress raids remains).&amp;#10;2. The Offering Draw Pile has been emptied.&amp;#10;3.

It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available. Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is preceded by the designer&#39;s other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas. Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace&#39;s Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Similar to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Steam&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/97903/terror-meeple-city" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Rampage: Terror in Meeple City</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.01</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Horror</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster! Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &amp;ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&amp;#10; Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&amp;#10; Toss a vehicle: If you&#39;re in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&amp;#10; Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster&#39;s body and blowing across the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game&#39;s end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that&#39;s revealed only upon use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133633/rarrr" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Rarrr!!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.74</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In RARRR!!, players first draft monster power cards in order to build their perfect monster, then draft power bid cards to fuel their monsters&#39; rampages through cities.

That player then draws a card or cards to see what he&#39;s encountered, pitting his heroic persona against foul enemies, dangerous locations, and fantastic strangers.

Each player starts with 11 cards in hand, and 11 cards are placed in a deck on the table. Each round, reveal the top card of the deck; each player then selects one card from hand and reveals them simultaneously. Whichever side - duck or robot &amp;mdash; has the highest sum has won the round, and whoever has played the lowest card of this side wins these cards. (In a tie for lowest, the next lowest card of this side wins; if no cards of the winning side are unique, then the deck wins.)

Details on why this is important in the description.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &amp;quot;red stars&amp;quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s different is that Risk Legacy&#39; changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction&#39;s two powers, affix that power&#39;s sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &amp;ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &amp;quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&amp;quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &amp;quot;match three symbols&amp;quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &amp;quot;major bonus,&amp;quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &amp;quot;disposable&amp;quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique, and plays better than any other version of Risk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179719/risk-game-thrones" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Risk: Game of Thrones</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.31</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Movies / TV / Radio theme, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Risk: Game of Thrones, based on the epic HBO series, features two ways to play, including factions of noble Houses vying for control of Westeros during the time of The War of the Five Kings, as well as Daenerys Targaryen&#39;s rise to power in Essos.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;War and chaos have descended upon the realms of Men. In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. SKIRMISH&amp;#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.

WORLD AT WAR&amp;#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/634/river-dragons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">River Dragons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Point to Point Movement, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board.

As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/875/roads-boats" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Roads &amp; Boats</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.75</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1999</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 240 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Civilization, Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Grid Movement, Line Drawing, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Roads &amp;amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they&#39;re produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160434/robin" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Robin</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.97</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Medieval, Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the fast-paced game Robin, you have just joined Robin Hood&#39;s merry men in Sherwood Forest.

Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &amp;ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &amp;ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village?

Now imagine that you&#39;re bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other&#39;s path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player&#39;s desire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot&#39;s &amp;quot;registers&amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don&#39;t act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can&#39;t reprogram any cards to fix it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156458/roborama" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">RoboRama</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.44</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Card Game, Deduction, Miniatures, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> In RoboRama the goal is simple: Race against the other players by constantly picking the right combination of action cards and routes for your robots in order to cross the arena.

This desperate battle has recently seen a new player, a secret Agency of Bounty Hunters, attempting to control the endless assaults on inner city life.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your task: Defeat and arrest criminals, defuse high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy city districts, and prevent assassins from completing their destructive path. You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as &amp;quot;The Agency&amp;quot;, created to control Rain City&#39;s crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions &amp;ndash; destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents &amp;ndash; in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms.

Each player has a map of the United States that&#39;s divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can&#39;t have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can&#39;t place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &amp;quot;guard&amp;quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &amp;quot;dupe&amp;quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round.

Unused dice can be converted into stockpile markers for future use. By purchasing improvements, players can gain more dice with special abilities, become more efficient at laying rail or stockpiling dice, or increase the points they receive when other players deliver cargo over their rails. Bonus points are awarded for delivering passengers quickly or delivering freight over long distances.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The large, two-sided, colorful board has two maps.

Each player has servants he will place appropriately on the nine parts of the palace. On his turn, a player will perform actions based on the number of servants available on each location. If he has, for example, three servants on the mint, he gets three pieces of gold. As a bonus, the player with the majority of servants on a location receives generally a bonus extra action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some places allow you to add new servants or to move them from room to room. The purpose is to earn gold and royal seals and to use those to recruit the lofty noblemen waiting in the castle park. The latter will be the main source of victory points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some noblemen benefits are that you can break the balance in the rooms of the palace and there are also cards with privileges, offering bonuses of the same nature that it is also possible to retain them in hand to score points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165986/royals" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Royals</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Royals, players take on the roles of the great noble houses of the 17th century, fighting for supremacy in Europe at that time.

In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Summary&amp;#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&amp;#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&amp;#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&amp;#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&amp;#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&amp;#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&amp;#10;- earn 2 coins&amp;#10;- take 2 temporary workers&amp;#10;- jump ahead in turn order&amp;#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="S"><div>S</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Saboteur</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Exploration, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Route/Network Building, Take That</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players take on the role of dwarves.

Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player&#39;s turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn&#39;t try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins.

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &amp;quot;violet&amp;quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down.

In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked.

In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when 3 (or is it all?) track lines are completely used up. Each city&#39;s value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104347/santiago-de-cuba" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Santiago De Cuba</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.96</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Commodity Speculation, Dice Rolling, Memory, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver, Point to Point Movement, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution! The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &amp;quot;broker&amp;quot;, but in reality you&#39;re a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &amp;ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &amp;quot;connections&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game, nine locals &amp;ndash; the Cubans &amp;ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &amp;ndash; one for each type of good &amp;ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn&#39;t have to deliver goods. If the ship&#39;s demand isn&#39;t met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &amp;ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33604/say-anything" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Say Anything</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.89</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think.

Loot is lifted from the mark by playing one of five action cards, most of which work best when played alone. But tread carefully: while many pieces of loot have unique abilities that can affect the game, each carries a suspicion value.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&amp;mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&amp;mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&amp;mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector&#39;s edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/152959/settlers-catan-15th-anniversary-wood-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Settlers of Catan: Deluxe Wooden Box</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 75</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> This entry is for editions of Catan that include the Catan: 5-6 Player Extension.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher&#39;s description of the 15th Anniversary Edition:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Embark on a quest to settle the fair isle of Catan!

But wait &amp;ndash; these aren&#39;t the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it&#39;s too late?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Reveals a rumor card.&amp;#10; Attempts a quest.&amp;#10; Accuses a knight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it&#39;s a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &amp;quot;It&#39;s time.&amp;quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan&#39;s forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur&#39;s kingdom falls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplements&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Shadows over Camelot&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146791/shadows-brimstone-city-ancients" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, American West, Exploration, Horror, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Role Playing</div><div><b>Description:</b> Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror!

As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures.

In one week, her majesty the Queen will attend their new shows and will grant her support to one of the troupes. It&#39;s the chance of a lifetime for the young authors who are inflaming the populace with ever more audacious and motley plays. But how do you create a masterpiece in such a short time? Whoever has the answer to this thorny question will probably enter the rolls of history!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Shakespeare, players are theater managers who must recruit actors, craftsmen, jewelers and others in order to assemble everything needed for the play&#39;s performance at week&#39;s end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, the game lasts six days and on each day players recruit one new character &amp;mdash; starting with five at the beginning of the game: four identical ones on their individual player board and one that they&#39;ve drafted &amp;mdash; and take 1-5 actions with the characters they have. Characters and their actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.&amp;#10; Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can&#39;t participate in the dress rehearsals.&amp;#10; Set dresser: Build the set. The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive &amp;mdash; but the set must be symmetrical!&amp;#10; Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need. These joes can assemble both costumes and sets, but they&#39;re not very good at it.&amp;#10; Assistant: Increase the power of your craftsmen, i.e., the three roles described above.&amp;#10; Jeweler: Take a gold costume element or set piece to dazzle the crowd.&amp;#10; Queen: Earn money by giving her an early peek, or gain an objective to win her favor on the final day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After players take actions, they check the individual ambience level in their theater, gaining or losing points or rehearsal time depending on the atmosphere. Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you&#39;ll be able to do tomorrow &amp;mdash; but those who don&#39;t plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points.

However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &amp;mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When placing ships, you can initially place only in &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;NOTE: this description is out-of-date.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75547/shipwrights-north-sea" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Shipwrights of the North Sea</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Medieval, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Commodity Speculation, Hand Management, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> Shipwrights of the North Sea is set in the early years of the Viking Age, circa 900 AD.

The tumultuous political conditions created the perfect breeding ground for the birth of a new form of government (called Signoria) and the rise of the most ambitious noble families. After having acted in the dark for a long time, the time has finally come for them to take control of the cities and shape Italy&amp;rsquo;s future. Their stories will go down in history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Signorie, you will play the role of a Signore, a Lord of one of the most prestigious families of the Renaissance. One at the time, players choose one die from a common pool. (Twenty dice in five colors are rolled at the beginning of each round.) You place it on your player board (your city) and perform one of the possible actions. The color of the chosen die determines the action, and the number on the die is a discount on the cost of the action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a round, each player can perform up to four actions. At the end of the round, if the sum of a player&#39;s chosen dice is equal or lower than 13, he can obtain a reward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The dice mechanism is easy and innovative and gives players a simple, but challenging choice. Money is always tight, so there is a temptation to choose a high valued dice, but that needs to be balanced with obtaining the reward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166443/sing-it" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Sing It!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.48</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Singing, Time Track</div><div><b>Description:</b> Are you ready for our grand lyrics competition?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the party game Sing it!, players draw a card, choose a word, and say the lyrics of the first song that comes to mind.

Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players&#39; heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &amp;ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp;amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it&#39;s a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp;amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp;amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121958/sky-traders" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Sky Traders</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Fantasy, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Commodity Speculation, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Command your own skyship and become a master merchant in Sky Traders, a board game of commerce and intrigue for two to five players. Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It&#39;s all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You&#39;ll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You&#39;ll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship&#39;s cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you&#39;ve angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As captain of your own skyship, you&#39;ll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&amp;rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FAQ &amp;amp; ERRATA: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3532&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182605/skyliners" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Skyliners</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Skyliners, players collectively build buildings and skyscrapers in a shared building plot, with each player trying to satisfy bets they&#39;ve made as to which buildings they&#39;ll be able to see in the five rows of buildings on their side of the playing area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31503/slide-5" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Slide 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Number</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players arrange their cards on the playing surface building &amp;ldquo;hills.&amp;rdquo; Once a hill gets five cards high, the sixth card will cause an &amp;ldquo;Avalanche&amp;rdquo; and that player must take all of the cards in the row, leaving the sixth card to start a new hill.

You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed. Sounds easy? How easy is it when an opponent&#39;s Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro &amp;ndash; try harder next time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try.

The mineral riches of the thriving Moon colony inspired legions of hearty Earth citizens to seek their fortunes in space. Humble rockets probed the farthest reaches of the solar system in an eager quest for resources, and brave colonists forged homes wherever they could survive. Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then the rumors began &amp;mdash; whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures. By the time the secret invasion was exposed, the aliens were everywhere. Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thus was born the Rocket Patrol &amp;ndash; an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions is a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84419/space-empires-4x" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Space Empires 4X</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.59</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hex-and-Counter, Secret Unit Deployment</div><div><b>Description:</b> Space Empires is a game in the finest tradition of 4X space games - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All was well in the galaxy &amp;ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &amp;quot;Wolf&amp;quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &amp;ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy&#39;s known history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders&#39; uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &amp;quot;Shepherd&amp;quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are a Sheep.&amp;#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&amp;#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&amp;#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&amp;#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Ewe&#39;s The Force...&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &amp;ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &amp;ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player&#39;s turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&amp;#10; Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&amp;#10; Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can&#39;t, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player&#39;s cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&amp;#10; If players have found a Defender, place the player&#39;s cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player&#39;s turn, Wolf attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can&#39;t discard enough cards &amp;ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &amp;ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128671/spartacus-game-blood-treachery" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Spartacus</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.51</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 150 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Betting/Wagering, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Trading, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Spartacus: A Game of Blood &amp;amp; Treachery, an exciting game of twisted schemes and bloody combats inspired by the hit STARZ Original series, each player takes on the role of Dominus, head of a rising house in the ancient Roman city of Capua. Each house is competing for Influence to gain the favor of Rome. Through a combination of political schemes and glorious battles on the arena sands your house will rise in fame and stature. As Dominus, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. Guards protect you from schemes launched by rivals. Slaves run your household and earn gold. Gladiators compete to bring glory to themselves and influence to their Dominus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three main phases occur in each game round of Spartacus: A Game of Blood &amp;amp; Treachery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Intrigue Phase is when players launch their Schemes, hoping to raise their fortunes while undermining their rivals. Schemes and Reactions are represented by cards in the Intrigue Deck. Players wield their Influence to put their Schemes into play, often asking for (or bribing) another player&amp;rsquo;s help in hatching the most complex plots.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Market Phase is when players buy, sell and trade Assets (Gladiators, Slaves, Equipment and Guards). Players also bid against each other to acquire new Assets at Auction. Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family&amp;rsquo;s power for years to come. During the game, players will bribe, poison, betray, steal, blackmail, and undermine each other. Gold will change hands again and again to buy support, stay someone&amp;rsquo;s hand or influence their decisions. Will you be the honorable player whose word is their bond or the treacherous schemer whose alliances change with the wind?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104573/spectaculum" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Spectaculum</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.41</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Enclosure, Commodity Speculation, Stock Holding, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Immerse yourself in the colorful world of fortune-tellers and snake dancers.

If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area.

With the two tracks in the game, those involved with delivery during the worker phase can then be used to raise money, to purchase an adjacent card, or to work on their own in an idle factory.

Players collect and trade these resources &amp;ndash; dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water &amp;ndash; in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Star Trek: Catan differs from the basic Settlers in one aspect: a set of Support Cards formerly available only in German as Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan. Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek. Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn&#39;t otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage.

It is built upon the cooperative board game model and the players will work together against the game itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, players assume the roles of Kirk, Spock, Bones and Uhura. The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;&amp;#10; Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;&amp;#10; And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it. or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the &amp;quot;expandable&amp;quot; board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot;!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/79127/star-trek-fleet-captains" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Star Trek Fleet Captains</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.61</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 75 - 75</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the &amp;quot;Prime Universe&amp;quot; of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions. Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe. In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation. Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &amp;ldquo;size.&amp;rdquo; Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win. Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then &amp;ldquo;shuffle build&amp;rdquo; a deck of command cards. Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction. Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters. For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character. The four decks chosen will help to set the player&amp;rsquo;s strategy for winning.&amp;#10;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions. These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck. Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game. Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&amp;rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored. As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &amp;ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&amp;rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes. Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat. Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat). The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178613/star-trek-five-year-mission" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Star Trek: Five Year Mission</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Star Trek: Five-Year Mission is a cooperative dice placement game for 3-7 players who take the roles of crew members of either the USS Enterprise (from the original Star Trek series) or the USS Enterprise-D (from Star Trek: The Next Generation).

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&amp;rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&amp;rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&amp;rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&amp;rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you&#39;ll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173341/loopin-chewie" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Star Wars: Loopin&#39; Chewie</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 3</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Aviation / Flight, Children&#39;s Game, Electronic, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Real-time, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Player Elimination</div><div><b>Description:</b> This 2-3 player version of Loopin&#39; Louie is re-themed with the Star Wars license.

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you&#39;ll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&amp;#10; As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you&#39;ll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you&#39;ll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you&#39;ll need to sway the galaxy&#39;s citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy&#39;s most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/939/star-wars-queens-gambit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Star Wars: The Queen&#39;s Gambit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.55</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting, Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Campaign / Battle Card Driven, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Based on the four battles at the end of Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace -- the battle on the plain between the Gungan forces and the droid army; the attempt by Naboo forces, led by Queen Amidala, to storm the palace and capture the Trade Federation viceroys; the fight between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights; and the space battle in which Anakin&#39;s starfighter destroyed the Droid Control Ship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The forces are represented by 155 plastic miniatures on three separate boards, including a three-level palace.

Players take action in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom, and on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn&#39;t in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &amp;mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &amp;mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &amp;mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121410/steam-park" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Steam Park</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Dice, Real-time, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Memory, Modular Board</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As owners of a fantastic steam park, you&#39;re to build gigantic, coal-powered rides to attract as many visitors as you can &amp;ndash; but building attractions won&#39;t be enough.

After the card has been chosen, the players start bidding on it or they can pass and not take part in the auction.

If you can outsmart your fellow pirates by using your brains and trading skills, you&#39;ll probably end up with the most valuable loot!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stingy is an interactive booty-swapping game for 2-6 players, with the booty in question being rum, parrots, coins, diamonds, and pirate flags; these first four items come in four colors, with 3-6 tiles of each item in those colors, while the pirate flags come only in black (as you might expect).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with six randomly drawn tiles, with the remainder of the tiles being scattered face down on the table or placed in the included pouch. On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp;amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it&#39;s impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &amp;mdash; but only for the complete groups that they&#39;ve collected. Whoever has the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &amp;quot;Captain Sly&amp;quot; variant in which an opponent who can&#39;t take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing.

Stockpile centers around the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&amp;rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34635/stone-age" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Stone Age</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.64</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Prehistoric</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Set Collection, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The &amp;quot;Stone Age&amp;quot; times were hard indeed.

It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &amp;quot;the Boss&amp;quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss&#39; army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven&#39;s defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now the four dark force armies &amp;ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &amp;ndash; begin their long march east.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dark Force Army Overview&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&amp;rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.&amp;#10;Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. &amp;#10;Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage. Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defender&amp;rsquo;s defenses. &amp;#10;Cons: Though your units are many, they don&amp;rsquo;t hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pros: Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.&amp;#10;Cons: Squishy units means you&amp;rsquo;ve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange &amp;ldquo;can I trust you&amp;rdquo; looks. Lack of strong melee units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137550/story-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Story War</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Mythology, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> It&amp;rsquo;s a card game for 3-to-8 players that combines storytelling and combat!

They also use Item cards (like Excalibur or Flying Carpet) to get them out of a tight spot and turn the battle around! Each battle is also set on a Battlefield (like Beanstalk or Sleepy Village) and players can use the terrain to their advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The actual battle is conducted by players describing their character&#39;s action to the judge, who has final ruling on all matters.

Bison or one of the other well-known characters as you travel to exotic locales seeking new challenges! While you begin armed only with basic combat maneuvers, you will add new, more powerful cards to your deck as you go, with the goal of defeating as many Stage Bosses as you can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Villains, Heroes, Equipment, Super Powers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &amp;quot;Line-Up&amp;quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and new surprises.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player has amassed enough Power, he may attempt to defeat the current Stage Boss. When a Stage Boss is attacked, it retaliates against the attacker! With Street Fighter, the action is often one-on-one. Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Chun-Li&#39;s Bracelets and Electric Thunder. Each player also has access to a special Ultra card that is one of his character&#39;s signature maneuvers. In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his deck wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155314/strike-pose" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Strike a Pose</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.64</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 50 - 50</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players in Strike A Pose need to do just that, with the poses they strike being presented to them on cards within the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, one player is the Guesser and must leave the room before everyone else does their thing.

By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles. A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles. If a zone tile is placed next to existing zone tiles, those existing tiles have the ability to create new improvements, which may also be placed at this time. Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they&#39;ve achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123260/suburbia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Suburbia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.69</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis.

Players will carefully select the best building tiles to erect the most impressive structures, scoring points for following patterns and fulfilling secret objectives.

There are separate stacks of tiles for each layer of the palace, color coded (blue, red, green, and sky). Besides the color-coded levels, there are attributes that have to match up, like doorways and columns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To get tiles, players reveal tiles from one pile and display them in front of the pile (up to 3 can be showing - the top of the pile is face up but can&#39;t be taken) and then choose a tile from any of the available tiles in any color. You try to choose a tile that will give you points and/or gems. The gems let you buy genies, which have special powers like building twice in one turn, or moving a tile you previously placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are limited by the edges of the starting board, including the bonus tiles (question marks). You have to have at least one tile beneath you to build, and you can&#39;t make a hole in the palace, so things are somewhat constrained. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped if you need the mirror-image tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player board has attributes that score points, like windows or plants. You also have 2 hidden objectives/bonuses, which might be points for making a column of windows. The game ends when someone builds their fifth sky tile.

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &amp;quot;decksploration&amp;quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it&#39;s also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players&#39; disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&amp;rsquo;s obstacles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &amp;mdash; Asylum &amp;mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you&#39;ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it&#39;s possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Official FAQ&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179820/tail-feathers" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tail Feathers</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Aviation / Flight, Fantasy, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Villainous rats have allied with vicious hunting birds to pillage the humble mouse settlement across Meanderfield.

The aim in the game is to enlarge your fortune thanks to smart investments in rolling stock.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take on the role of investors who meet at the locomotive auction and try to buy the best of auctioned railway vehicles. Locomotive cards are not the only ones available for purchase though, because investors also compete for the most valuable railway wagons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played for three rounds, each of which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the players bid locomotive cards. The auction type in each round is determined by drawing one of the six auction tokens. During the bidding of locomotive cards, the players should pay attention not only to its price, but also to the multiplier placed on the card (the higher, the greater the potential profits) as well as the locomotive speed. Once all the players have already purchased three locomotives, the second stage takes place. In this stage they are attaching wagons to their locomotives. They also make a choice: either to take one of the face-up wagon cards and attach to one of their locomotives, to pass and do not take any card, or to pay for replacing cards on the table and only then decide, whether to take one of the available wagons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round is over when one of the locomotives of any player has its fifth wagon attached. Then, all the players are summing up the profits. Each player adds up the value of the wagons attached to the locomotive, then the obtained score is multiplied by the multiplier of the locomotive. This process is repeated for each of the locomotives. The earned money supplies the player&#39;s account. After three rounds, all the players add up their earned money. The player who earned the most, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Take a Train is an entertaining and exciting game, which gives everyone a chance to feel like a rail market tycoon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70919/takenoko" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Takenoko</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.37</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Environmental, Farming, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Pattern Building, Set Collection, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor.

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&amp;#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who&#39;s placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player&#39;s turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent&#39;s growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30645/tammany-hall" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tammany Hall</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.32</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Negotiation, Political, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> &amp;quot;The way to have Power is to take it&amp;quot; - William &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot; Tweed&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs.

An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor&#39;s grip on the city is tenuous at best.

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&amp;rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes three different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player&#39;s own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &amp;ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don&#39;t expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent&#39;s moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181404/taverna" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Taverna</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> It is Saint-Averna&#39;s day, the holiest day in the kingdom of Averna.

Strongholds unlock a group&#39;s special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&amp;#10; Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&amp;#10; Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&amp;#10; Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&amp;#10; Forest (Witches, Auren)&amp;#10; Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&amp;#10; Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132544/tesla-vs-edison-war-currents/expansions" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tesla vs. Edison</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Economic, Educational, Industry / Manufacturing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Commodity Speculation, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Stock Holding, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tesla vs. Edison: War of Currents is a fast-playing, route building, economic and worker placement game focused on invention and industry in the roaring 1880&#39;s.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/503/through-desert" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Through the Desert</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.06</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1998</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Animals, Arabian</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Enclosure, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher&#39;s Description&amp;#10;From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&amp;#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&amp;#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe&#39;s caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert&#39;s oases? Don&#39;t forget to keep an eye on your opponents&#39; caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108906/thunder-alley" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Thunder Alley</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.48</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Thunder Alley is a stock car racing game for 2&amp;ndash;7 players with the feel and flexibility of a card-driven simulation. Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&amp;ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner&#39;s circle looking in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&amp;#10; Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&amp;#10; Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What&#39;s more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other. The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned (triangle) raceway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best. An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/169652/turbo-rally-card-racing-thunder-track" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Thunder Track</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> THUNDER TRACK takes careful planning, patience, wit, and a healthy dose of foresight to become a champion.

Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, player&#39;s will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Integrates with&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&amp;#10; Thunderstone: Dragonspire&amp;#10; Thunderstone: Starter Set&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21790/thurn-and-taxis" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Thurn and Taxis</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2006</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Renaissance, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Thurn &amp;amp; Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may only build one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tichu</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.62</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1991</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Hand Management, Partnerships, Trick-taking</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tichu is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it&#39;s your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &amp;mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &amp;mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player&#39;s unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &amp;mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &amp;quot;Tichu&amp;quot; prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &amp;quot;Grand Tichu&amp;quot; after looking at only her first eight cards for a &amp;plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-ride" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ticket to Ride</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains, Travel</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn.

But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &amp;quot;train robbing,&amp;quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards. All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored. Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between. A player&#39;s turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets. Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck. When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color. Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent&#39;s Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent&#39;s Railyard. If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color. This is called &amp;quot;Train robbing.&amp;quot; When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends. In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck. When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends. At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored. The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted. To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets. Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city. These bonus points are added to the player&#39;s score. The player scoring the most total points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14996/ticket-ride-europe" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ticket to Ride: Europe</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.60</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains, Travel</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe.

The board for M&amp;auml;rklin is based on a map of Germany and each individual card in the deck depicts a different M&amp;auml;rklin Trains model. A DVD introducing players to the M&amp;auml;rklin line of model trains is included [Edit: DVD no longer included in recent runs.]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;M&amp;auml;rklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries. A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens. When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities. The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question. Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger. Moving along a player&#39;s own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through. A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game&#39;s longest route bonus).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31627/ticket-ride-nordic-countries" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.67</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 3</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains, Transportation, Travel</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries takes you on a Nordic adventure through Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden as you travel to the great northern cities of Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm.

The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp;amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &amp;quot;ziggurat expansion&amp;quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp;amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others state that they&#39;re for 3-4 players.

Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire after a fine meal finished off with Cuban cigars and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues. To a man they clamour their unanimous assent and it is decided to join forces and go back to Tikal. Appointments are made, patrons are found, equipment is assembled, notes are compared, and then they are off.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An uneventful journey takes them to Guatemala, and then on to the old site. Not too long after, they discover that there is indeed an undisturbed temple in an adjacent valley. As it belonged to a long-forgotten king, the temple promises many surprises and much, much gold.

Collecting and delivering treasures is one, and having the majority in some rooms or exploring the main temple as well as an outer secret chamber, are others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tikal II calls for careful planning, as your scientist can&#39;t move freely within the temple without specific items, and tension, as the actions around the board grow scarce.

Players control a home galaxy and a fleet of space ships. As players upgrade their galaxies, they gain access to more ships and more dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, a player rolls a set of dice; how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player&#39;s galaxy.

In Titans of Industry, you must invest in building factories and businesses in order to produce goods and sell them to gain victory points (VPs). Game play involves a delicate balance of money, production, and goals. The person who can best manage his buildings and meet his goals in seven years will win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts the game with four workers and $6,000. Every turn, players first buy buildings, then place workers on those buildings or on the board. Factories allow you to produce goods, while Businesses allow you to sell those goods for money or VPs. A good player needs to balance production and sales, and encourage other players to sell with them to maximize sales. Board elements allow players to take advantage of bonuses, such as extra production, building improvements, and Corporate Strategy cards. Corporate Strategy cards help give players additional goals and direction, by specifying additional ways to gain victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three times during the game &amp;ndash; years 1923, 1925, and 1927 &amp;ndash; upkeep will be due, and players must pay to maintain their buildings, or will need to take out loans. Players will need to sell enough goods before then to have enough money to cover the costs, as loans are worth negative victory points at the end of the game. After year 1927, whoever has the most victory points from combined sales, buildings, and Corporate Strategy cards wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Titans of Industry, which allows 3-6 players and plays in approximately 20-25 minutes per player, is a rich worker-placement/resource-management Euro-style game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42215/tobago" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tobago</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.13</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps.

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay&#39;s prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city&#39;s three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each player&#39;s district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It&#39;s up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game&#39;s box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Summary&amp;#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &amp;#10; Then take one action:&amp;#10; Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&amp;#10; Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else&#39;s card, etc.&amp;#10; Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&amp;#10; Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player&#39;s turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you&#39;ve combated.

The first player to construct all three of his tower segments wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A big theme of Tower is scarcity of resources, with only 18 resources in a four-player game. It&#39;s likely that in any given play session there will be enough resources for only one player, forcing everyone to play dirty in order to come out on top.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The black market provides a source for players to hire thugs to carry out some pretty shady actions. These range from intimidation, to stealing resources from other players, and robbing Salil, the tax collector.

Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player&#39;s scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is a set collection game at its core. Player are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase good when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a player&#39;s turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can&#39;t take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can&#39;t be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a payout occurs, each player that has good on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148319/tragedy-looper" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tragedy Looper</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Murder/Mystery</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tragedy Looper is a scenario-based deduction game for two to four players: one mastermind and one to three protagonists. The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards. Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats.

In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &amp;ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2842/transamerica" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Transamerica</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2001</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Trains, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> TransAmerica is a very simple railway game.

It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8&amp;quot; blocks, of 7 types (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can win peacefully by: &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of six: each player controls three).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&amp;rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.&amp;#10; The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Diplomatic infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Industrial buildup (via Investment cards), with&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Technology advancement (also via Investment cards), and some&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&amp;rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triumph &amp;amp; Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/73439/troyes" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Troyes</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.74</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Economic, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Troyes, recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else&#39;s, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player&#39;s tile may also extend your own path in a direction you&#39;d rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Theme:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &amp;quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&amp;quot;, and the game as a whole representing &amp;quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player&#39;s token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player&#39;s token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other notes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124172/tsuro-seas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tsuro of the Seas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Route/Network Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie&#39;s Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &amp;mdash; that is, keep on the game board &amp;mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn players add &amp;quot;wake&amp;quot; tiles to the 7&amp;times;7 game board; each tile has two &amp;quot;wake connections&amp;quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player&#39;s turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they&#39;ll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted!

If you leave enough commodities for the people after taxation, all is well and you can continue to build monuments to your own vanity. But if you take too much, the greediest of you will be punished. Who will build the most statues and win the game?

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &amp;quot;spent&amp;quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol&#39;s fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet&#39;s surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol&#39;s own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet&#39;s wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player&#39;s military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction&#39;s leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game&#39;s asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Twilight Imperium: Third Edition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.91</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Negotiation, Political, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area-Impulse, Dice Rolling, Hex-and-Counter, Modular Board, Trading, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The &#39;designer notes&#39; in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from &#39;Puerto Rico&#39; to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of &#39;Settlers of Catan&#39;, while the &amp;quot;Command&amp;quot; system cleverly improves on the &#39;oil&#39; logistical mechanism of &#39;Attack&#39; to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Twilight Imperium (second edition)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire&amp;#10; Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolk-mayan-calendar" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Tzolk&#39;in: The Mayan Calendar</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.97</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Civilization, Economic, Farming, Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement.

When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &amp;quot;later&amp;quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it&#39;s wise to let the time work for you &amp;ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear.

At the start of play, each player places his pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &amp;mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2015 edition:&amp;#10;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46396/ubongo-3d" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ubongo 3D</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.20</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Puzzle, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Newest addition to the Ubongo series.

The starting player plays a card from hand, then in clockwise order the other players play a card of the same color, if possible, while playing a different color otherwise.

If none of the players followed suit, then the first one wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner places the cards on his kingdom cards, starting from left to right and sorted by color. If you have nothing on your kingdom cards yet, you can sort the cards from left to right in any order.

Architect, mayor, planner, engineer and a spy will do all they can to create new places of public use so that living in your metropolis is more comfortable than anywhere else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the centre of the Urban Panic play area is a main board with open city tiles placed on it. Next to the board lies a face-down pile with the remaining tiles. Each player receives a player board, and on this board you will build a city. In your turn, you have to perform actions of the architect which will enable you to take one tile from the main board. In the current turn, you can perform two more actions. You may exchange all of the revealed tiles with those from the pile, place a tile on your board, or change the places of two tiles on your board. Each building added to the city results in its development: number of residents, number of workplaces, ecology, revenue or the satisfaction of residents either increases or decreases. The most important thing is to fill the board with city tiles so that each tile is connected to the center of the board. You cannot forget to fulfill the needs of the residents. The winner is the player who not only builds and develops the city fastest, but avoids unemployment and takes care of the residents&#39; needs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62220/urban-sprawl" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Urban Sprawl</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the publisher&#39;s website]:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Overview:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Urban Sprawl is a game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players. Urban Sprawl abstractly models the growth of a town into a teeming metropolis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players assume the roles of entrepreneur, tycoon, and politician&amp;mdash;each helping in the development of a hypothetical &amp;quot;Anywhere, USA.&amp;quot; Wealth and Prestige will be earned and spent throughout the game. Buildings will rise only to later be demolished for better and larger fare.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game players will gather valuable Permits. These will result in either a wealthy Investment or the foundation of a new building Contract. Players will strive to become dominant in one or more building Zones in order to acquire beneficial political offices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&amp;mdash;a vibrant metropolis that is revered around the world&amp;mdash;when the player with the most Prestige will be crowned the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The grid of streets on the board provides the framework for building the small town. The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player&#39;s contribution to the growing urban area. Each building&#39;s value is determined by the cumulative Wealth and Prestige values of the block in which is it constructed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of a player&#39;s turn he may discard one or more Building Permit cards from hand as &amp;quot;Investments,&amp;quot; gaining Wealth in doing so. Next that player gets 6 &amp;quot;Action Points&amp;quot; (APs) with which to spend on any of the the following activities:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Acquiring new Building Permit cards from those available to choose;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Constructing new buildings from those currently available;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Acquiring a &amp;quot;Favor&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;a Building Contract that only that player can build.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each activity carries with it a variable cost in APs, depending on where the chosen card lies on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player has spent his APs it&#39;s time for a quick reset phase in readiness for the next player&#39;s turn. It is during this phase that events can occur, elections can be held for the various political offices, and players receive payouts in Wealth and Prestige. Wealth payouts provide funding for new buildings while Prestige payouts provide victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Generally, players will be trying to build in areas that provide better payouts. Players are also looking to construct more buildings of a particular &amp;quot;zone&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;Government, Residential, Industrial, or Commercial&amp;mdash;in order to help them win an election, as the politicians each confer a special ability to the player holding the office. Many of the buildings also provide a one-time bonus as they are built, and players can benefit from construction in the right neighborhoods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game, the values of the buildings will generally increase as the town grows into a city and then a large metropolis. Neighborhoods that were once valuable can become run down and new city centers spring up as the urban areas sprawl out across the grid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each Prestige row, earn points based on accumulated Wealth, and score bonus points for political offices held&amp;mdash;after which the player with the highest Prestige total wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93541/urbania" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Urbania</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;In Urbania the city center has seen glory in its past.

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&amp;rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city. Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&amp;rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&amp;rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&amp;rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner. Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden?

To gain clout and fortune (i.e., victory points), families extend their Influence outside the city, sending representatives to foreign markets.

In the meantime, players compete inside the city for the coveted title of Doge, the head of the government, spending resources and Ducati (money) to gain popularity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But the hegemony of Venice over the Mediterranean is threatened by many enemies. The Republic faces the rise of competing powers, such as the rival seafaring Republic of Genoa and the Crown of Aragon to the west, or the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Turks to the east. Century after century, players will take part in the struggle that will see the rise and fall of the Republic of Venice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Venetia is played across three epochs: Rise, Apogee and Struggle. A Power track on the board is used to record the passage of time. Venice starts the game in its Rise, and the game ends when the Struggle epoch is completed.

The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house. Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold. Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location. The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175592/village-crone" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Village Crone</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.20</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b></div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Modular Board, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Become a witch and enter the medieval world of Wickersby in this worker placement, resource management game with spellcasting! Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch&#39;s Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord&#39;s manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch&#39;s Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord&#39;s manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord&#39;s manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch&#39;s Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch&#39;s Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch&#39;s Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player&#39;s turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch&#39;s Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player&#39;s familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch&#39;s Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158316/villainy" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Villainy</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.11</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Comic Book / Strip</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Villainy is a game about aspiring super villains competing to be the first to enact their evil plans and overcome Fantastiman, that pesky superhero who watches over the city day and night. It is a fun card-driven character building game featuring a hilarious uncontrolled narrative that unfolds differently every time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As an aspiring super villain, you are trying to make your mark in the world. In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night. You must hire minions to aid you in your quest for world domination. You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Mechanics Description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member&#39;s stats, earning money, and completing objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member&#39;s stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player&#39;s action throughout the game. Typically these fights award a bonus to one player without hurting another. It is these challenges and several special abilities that steal from other players that make up the majority of player to player direct conflict.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42052/vinhos" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Vinhos</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.56</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 135</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Industry / Manufacturing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Vinhos (Portuguese word for &amp;quot;wines&amp;quot;) is a trading and economic game about wine making.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite its small size, Portugal is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading wine producers.

They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There&#39;s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards).

One card starts in the center of the table. Each card is double-sided, and each side features four of five symbols on it (mask, amulet, voodoo doll, magic potion and top hat) in four of five colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players play at the same time, trying to play their cards in hand. To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says &amp;quot;Voodoo!&amp;quot; and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile.

In 1625, the Thirty Years&#39; War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &amp;quot;years,&amp;quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &amp;ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one&#39;s control &amp;ndash; wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each of the &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After revealing that round&#39;s event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can&#39;t deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower&#39;s baffles to possibly emerge in the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wallenstein includes two expansions: &amp;quot;Emperor&#39;s Court,&amp;quot; in which a player&#39;s army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court&#39;s entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &amp;quot;Landsknechte,&amp;quot; which can be used with &amp;quot;Emperor&#39;s Court&amp;quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card.

Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.

An army of unspeakable horrors of an ancient and forgotten race of infernal creatures awoke deep within the earth and marched across the lands. The Darkness ravished the Five Realms with death and destruction and nearly brought the continent to its knees. Faced with a desperate fight for their very survival, the great races put aside their differences and united into a warband of such magnitude and strength as had never been seen before. The world trembled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though their great loss of life on the battlefield was nearly insurmountable, the warband&#39;s sheer size overpowered the armies of Darkness and largely drove them back beneath the earth. Sorcerers and shamans and magi of the great races invoked binding blood magic to start sealing the enemy away for an eternity. In the final days of battle to determine the fate of the lands, the hordes of Darkness and the great warband clash on four remaining battle fronts that are each located near a border landmark that separate the kingdoms of the Five Realms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last four campaigns wage on. The end is near. May the Maker protect us all....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a player in Warband: Against the Darkness, you control the warband armies of one of the great fantasy races of the Five Realms. Although the great races are currently working together in mutual defense, old habits and rivalries are hard to break and this isn&#39;t in any way a co-operative game. It&#39;s important that your kind emerges victorious from the war with more battle prestige and honor than your temporary and untrustworthy comrades. The player who collects the most Victory Points of one-upmanship for their race by the conclusion of the final battle against the Darkness &amp;ndash; gained by advancing your soldiers in the warband, earning gold for your army captains, reconnoitering the combat fronts with your scouts, and defeating enemies on the battlefields &amp;ndash; has achieved the greatest leadership glory and is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Warband: Against the Darkness is perfectly balanced in the design space between Euro and Ameri-style gameplay, combining strategic depth with an evocative fantasy theme and tense player conflict.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181521/warhammer-quest-adventure-card-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Warhammer Quest</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.86</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Role Playing, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Join forces with legendary heroes to brave the many dangers of a cavernous dungeon.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson&#39;s diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes&#39; allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Watson &amp;amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&amp;oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &amp;#10;Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&amp;aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&amp;ntilde;ar&amp;aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&amp;oacute;n de una serie de casos in&amp;eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&amp;oacute;n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber&amp;aacute; sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra&amp;iacute;das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l&amp;oacute;gica deductiva.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Y, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu&amp;eacute;l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar&amp;aacute; la confianza del genio de Baker Street.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;El juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu&amp;aacute;les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar&amp;aacute; de resolver antes que los dem&amp;aacute;s.&amp;#10;Para ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder&amp;aacute;n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci&amp;oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&amp;aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&amp;aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&amp;aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&amp;uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&amp;aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&amp;aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.&amp;#10;Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&amp;aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&amp;oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes. Hecho esto, se devolver&amp;aacute;n las cartas de pista a su lugar para que los dem&amp;aacute;s puedan leerla en rondas posteriores.&amp;#10;Este procedimiento se repetir&amp;aacute; cada ronda, hasta que un jugador crea haber hallado la soluci&amp;oacute;n al caso: en ese momento, habr&amp;aacute; de dirigirse al 221B para comprobar si sus respuestas son acertadas.&amp;#10;En caso de ser todas correctas, habr&amp;aacute; ganado. En caso de error, habr&amp;aacute; perdido y se retirar&amp;aacute; de la partida.&amp;#10;Cada detective contar&amp;aacute;, adem&amp;aacute;s, con la inestimable ayuda de una serie de aliados de Sherlock Holmes, as&amp;iacute; como con la del propio detective y, sobre todo, la del buen Dr. Watson.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42448/we-didnt-playtest-either" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">We Didn&#39;t Playtest This Either</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many will enter, some will win.

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140457/ultimate-werewolf-inquisition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Werewolf Inquisition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.69</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 12</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Horror, Murder/Mystery</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Role Playing, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> A terrible thing is happening in a local village: Werewolves are responsible for the deaths of many villagers.

At the start of each race, players receive a hand of five cards, with each card bearing a value from -4 to +5. The players&#39; pawns start each race on 0 of the racing track. Each turn, players choose a card from their hands and choose which pawn to move with this card, then reveal them simultaneously and move the selected pawns forward or backward based on the cards they played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After five turns, the race ends and the player in second place on the racing track wins, scoring a number of points equal to his position on the race track. All other players score nothing. (If the winner is in the negative portion of the racing track, he loses points instead.) After five races, sum all of the points scored; the player with the second highest total who has won at least one race wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This revised version of Why First? has new rules, including simultaneous actions by players that cuts down the playing time from the original release.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1382/winners-circle" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Winner&#39;s Circle</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2001</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Racing, Sports</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A re-issue by Alea of Knizia&#39;s Turf Horse Racing published by Gibsons Games. This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it&#39;s nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it&#39;s even crossed the start line. I&#39;ve never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game. There&#39;s also a sprint bonus in the race and a penalty for the last horse.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Republished by Face 2 Face Games as &amp;quot;Winner&#39;s Circle&amp;quot; in 2006.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Royal Turf&amp;quot; is #2 in the Alea small box series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122599/winter-tales" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Winter Tales</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.35</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Book, Card Game, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Partnerships, Point to Point Movement, Role Playing, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Following the victory in the Conflict of Autumn, The Regime of Winter has clutched the Land of Fairy Tales in its cold grasp.

In the winding alleys and the small houses desperately clinging to the hillside of Wintertown, frightened Tales move in the shadows, knowing they cannot allow all Hope for the future to be snuffed out by the cold and ready to fight to drive Winter away and let Spring come again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Winter Tales, a storytelling board game, players tell the tale of the conflict between the characters of fairy tales, who represent all that is good and hopeful, and the Soldiers of Winter, who incarnate evil and the fierce cold of Winter. Players will ally themselves with one of the warring Factions, controlling characters and fighting for the comeback of Spring or the suffocation of all hope, bringing on an endless Winter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winter Tales is an ever-changing game as each time the players will tell a completely different story, creating a shared plot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147116/witcher-adventure-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Witcher: Adventure Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Novel-based, Travel, Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area Movement, Dice Rolling, Pick-up and Deliver, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Witcher Adventure Game takes players on a journey across the world of The Witcher, a detailed world, rich in lore and characters, fleshed out by Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s famous series of novels, and honed by The Witcher video game trilogy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players assume the roles of four distinct characters from this series: Geralt of Rivia, monster slayer&amp;#205;&amp;#190; Triss Merigold, cunning sorceress&amp;#205;&amp;#190; Yarpen Zigrin, dwarven warrior&amp;#205;&amp;#190; and Dandelion, roguish bard. Each character has unique skills and multiple ways of overcoming obstacles, but you decide what to do during the game: Do you fight your way to victory, call on your charm, or try your hand at diplomacy? You can bring enemies around to your point of view with a sword as Geralt - or bribe them with gold and threaten to call on powerful friends as Dandelion. If a situation calls for strength in numbers, Yarpen has his own fellowship of dwarves to command, and Triss can rely on her expert skill with magic to save the day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each character has its own deck of Development Cards, so each time you play you can discover something new by trying out varied characters and experimenting with different builds. For example, when playing as Geralt of Rivia, the main hero of the Witcher franchise, you can develop your character either by specializing in brewing and utilizing combat Elixirs, or else by growing your ability to cast powerful Witcher Signs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A variety of quests invite players to hunt monsters, earn gold and interact with the characters they meet in a web of alliances and treachery. Decide whether you&amp;rsquo;ll help the other players or look after your own interests first, and keep an eye on the progress of your friends while you carefully work your way towards victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137095/witches-discworld-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Witches: A Discworld Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.11</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Witches: A Discworld Game is the second of three games by Martin Wallace set in Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld, the first being Discworld: Ankh-Morpork.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Witches is set in the magically charged land of Lancre.

Two to four players begin the game by choosing an ability-granting Role Card and starting in the United States. Players roll a die to initiate the zombie threat, represented by horde tokens of strengths 1 through 4 placed in zones around the board. Special &amp;quot;grey zones&amp;quot; represent lack of intel by featuring face-down tokens with zombie hordes of unknown strengths. Throughout the game, players travel to different zones and battle the zombie hordes in those locations by rolling dice and adding effects of Combat Cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features a die-based combat system. Humans always roll a six-sided die, while the hordes are represented by either a six-, eight-, ten-, or twelve-sided die depending on their strength. Humans may modify their role or add additional effects by playing Combat Cards, which consist of reusable Weapons (including Lobos, slang for &amp;quot;Lobotomizers&amp;quot;) and one-shot Tactics (like Booby Traps or Redeployment). Every time a human wins a battle, the zombie horde strength decreases by one level, while victories for zombies cause players to discard Combat Cards. At the end of each turn, humans draw a Threat Escalation card to reveal how the zombie threat has grown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though players start the game working together against the zombies, when a player loses all his Combat cards, he becomes one of the undead. Player-zombies can manipulate the hordes on the board to attack other humans and to escalate the zombie threat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds based on the number of players (six rounds for four players, seven for three, and eight for two). At the end of the game, if more than ten total zombie hordes of strength 3 or 4 still remain on the map, the humans lose (and any zombie players win). If ten or fewer such hordes remain, the humans collectively win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168433/world-smog-her-majestys-service" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">World of Smog: On Her Majesty&#39;s Service</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.08</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Fantasy, Miniatures, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Set Collection, Stock Holding, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> Set in the fantastic steampunk The World of Smog created by Panache Animation, On Her Majesty&#39;s Service is a stylish board game for two to four competing players.

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Where the world&#39;s militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &amp;mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The app&#39;s primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game&#39;s tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion&#39;s next strikes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you&#39;ll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&amp;rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&amp;rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you&#39;ll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159109/xenoshyft-onslaught" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">XenoShyft Onslaught</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.20</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 4</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Horror, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Co-operative Play, Deck / Pool Building, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In XenoShyft: Onslaught, a strategic base defense deck-builder, players take on the role of the NorTec Military, charged with defending their base against the onslaught of the alien &amp;quot;Hive&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;XenoShyft: Onslaught combines classic deck-building and resource management with fast-paced combat and unique &amp;quot;base defense&amp;quot; elements.
