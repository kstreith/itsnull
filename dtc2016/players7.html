One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has 'no chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.&#10;&#10;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&#10;&#10;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/432/6-nimmt" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>6 Nimmt!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.89</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1994</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>7 Wonders</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Civilization</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="A"><div>A</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137336/archer-danger-zone-board-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Archer: Danger Zone</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 4.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Channeling the action, adventure and danger that comes with everyday life in the Archer animated series, Archer: The Danger Zone! Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &quot;come on&quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.&#10;&#10;The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &quot;Office Map&quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Arkham Horror</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Role Playing, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> &#10; The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties.

Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells.

Progress during &quot;The War to End All Wars&quot; was measured by yards, not miles. The Italians were on the side of the Allies, while Turkey &ndash; then at the center of the Ottoman Empire &ndash; was one of the members of what was known as the Central Powers. Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the two other main Central Powers.&#10;&#10;The major Allies, sometimes referred to as the Entente, consisted of the British Empire, France, Italy, the United States, and Imperial Russia. The alliance included other historical members, but they more or less fell under the command and control of one of these great powers. In fact, had General Pershing not insisted that its integrity be maintained, even the American army would have found itself as simply being replacements for French and British.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies: WWI 1914 puts players in charge of one of the major powers, each with its own infantry sculpt; other sculpts represent the artillery, tanks, aircraft, and naval line-up of either the Allies or the Central Powers.&#10;&#10;As designer Larry Harris notes, &quot;While playing this game, you will quickly realize that this is not World War II. There are no massive sweeps across continents with blitzing armored divisions and aircraft. Instead, there are a series of determined offensives resisted by equally determined armies dedicated to holding the line. You will find that your depleting resources of men and artillery must be deployed with great thought and efficiency. You will be fighting pretty much the way man has been fighting with each other for thousands of years &ndash; only this time the ability to kill your enemy, and for him to kill you, has become intolerably efficient.&quot;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="B"><div>B</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Bang!

Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It's an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&#10;&#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first? Play continues until one team meets its winning condition &ndash; and death won't necessarily keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168435/between-two-cities" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Between Two Cities Special Edition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.23</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building, Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Partnerships, Set Collection, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> It is the early 1800s, a time of immense construction and urbanization.

On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability.

Disguised by a secret identity, they try to kidnap the Elder of the opposing clan or give their lives for the benefit of their own Elder. Malicious attacks, aimed indiscretions, and assistance from others will slowly uncover the truth: Who fights for whom? And who is the Elder?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player knows three things:&#10;&#10;&#10; Who he is and to which clan he belongs&#10; That a few other players are his allies, while everyone else is the enemy of both him and his clan&#10; The clan to which one of his neighbors belongs &ndash; although some characters can lie about their clan identity&#10;&#10;&#10;Now the players have to figure out who the Elder of the opposing team is (if there is one) and capture him.

Each player has an ability unique to his character, and this ability can be used only at the moment that he reveals his rank. The Assassin forces players to suffer wounds, for example, while the Guardian protects a player of the character's choice.&#10;&#10;In the end, if you capture your rival clan's Elder, you win &ndash; but if you capture the wrong vampire, you've fallen into the enemy's trap and lose the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11/bohnanza" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Bohnanza</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.08</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1997</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Farming, Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them. To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making. One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players.&#10;&#10;The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173441/bring-your-own-book" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Bring Your Own Book</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.35</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your old favorite book is now your new favorite game! In Bring Your Own Book, players take turns drawing prompts from the deck, then race to find the best phrase in their own book that satisfies the prompt. What's the tastiest &ldquo;name for a candy bar&rdquo; in that history textbook you're reading for school? How quickly can you find &ldquo;lyrics from a country western song&rdquo; in your dog-training guide? What kind of &ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?&#10;&#10;In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&#10;&#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/114438/wait-theres-more" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>But Wait, There&#39;s More!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.08</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Have you ever wanted a glass, that stops messy accidents before they happen, or pants, that provide relief at the touch of a button?

They each act as a member of a secret association, but no one knows who is friend and who is foe.&#10;&#10;Each player starts in one of two secret associations. He also gets a secret profession with a special ability. So at the beginning of the game you have no information about the membership and the professions of the others. To win the game, each association has to collect 3 defined artifacts jointly. Therefore you have to find out who your allies are and where to find the artifacts among the other secret objects that are in possession of other players. You can get this information during the game either by trading objects with other players, because every object has a special ability, e.g. &quot;Trade it in and you may take a look at your trading partners-association.&quot; or by struggling with other players, because the winner of a struggle can view the cards of the underdog and steal one of them. But be careful, all players can support the attacker OR defender in a struggle. If they know about your identity but you don't know theirs it may be risky to struggle.&#10;&#10;Turn actions, one of:&#10;Trade&#10;Duel&#10;Spy - Choose another player and draw one random object card from her/his hand.

Players must declare for one or the other and abstentions are not allowed.&#10;&#10;Victory: Declare Victory by naming your team and who has the three items, starting with yourself, then one by one. If you name players on your team incorrectly or they don't have the object(s) you lose. You can also declare victory by announcing the opposing team and the members of that team holding their objects by naming them, as firstly part of the team, and secondly that they have a relevant object.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/478/citadels" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Citadels</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.17</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, City Building, Fantasy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!&#10;&#10;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&#10;&#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&#10;&#10;Roles&#10;&#10;Forensic Scientist x1&#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.&#10;&#10;Murderer x1&#10;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo; respectively.&#10;&#10;The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Investigators x8&#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&#10;&#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.&#10;&#10;Accomplice x1&#10;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.&#10;&#10;Witness x1&#10;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.&#10;&#10;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125368/dino-hunt-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Dino Hunt Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.90</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Children&#39;s Game, Dice, Party Game, Prehistoric</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;How many dinosaurs can you catch?

Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash.

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="F"><div>F</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169124/flick-em" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Flick &#39;em Up!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.36</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, American West</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> The cities in the West are not the safest place to be.

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round. The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10; Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10; Pyramid Card &#10; Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10; Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="I"><div>I</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37759/incan-gold" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Incan Gold</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2006</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Bluffing, Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.

Factories fire their machines twenty-four hours a day, and demand is skyrocketing in the cities. A small but fierce rivalry of shipping barons must manage their amazing airships and the extensive railroad system in order to get goods to the cities before the demand is met by someone else. Anyone who can't stay competitive will be left with nothing but dust in their coffers!&#10;&#10;The process is simple: Factories produce the goods (machinery, textiles, chemicals, food, and luxuries) that are coveted by the city folk. Airships &ndash; forbidden from landing in the cities but capable of carrying cargo over great distances &ndash; must be used to gather those goods and deliver them to depots along the rail network. Trains then haul the goods to the cities that want them, earning cash for the competitor who gets there first! Will you be the &quot;King of Air and Steam?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kings of Air and Steam spans five rounds, and at the beginning of each round, players plan their Airship flights using four of their movement cards. When everyone is ready, everyone reveals their first planned card. According to the turn order and movement limits of their cards, players move their Airships, then take an Action; Actions include Building Depots, Upgrading your Airship or Train, Shipping Goods by rail, and Soliciting Funds from the bank. When all players have acted, the second planned cards are revealed, and so on through the four planned cards until all players have finished carrying out their plans for the round. All the while, players must keep aware of the rising values of the different types of Goods and try to get the most-valuable Goods from the specialized factories that produce them to the cities that want them. At the end of the game, the player with the most money and the greatest shipping network will be declared King of Air and Steam!&#10;&#10;Kings of Air and Steam includes seven teams of characters, each with unique powers to give them a competitive edge, and a modular game board that makes each game a different experience.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="L"><div>L</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124380/ladies-gentlemen" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.64</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Party Game, Post-Napoleonic, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Partnerships, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> The unusual and asymmetric game Ladies &amp; Gentlemen brings players into the world of glamour.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="N"><div>N</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65515/nuns-run" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Nuns on the Run</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.59</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Humor, Religious</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Paper-and-Pencil, Pick-up and Deliver, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Nuns on the Run, most of the players are novices who are eager to secretly explore the grand abbey at night in order to fulfill their &ldquo;secret wish.&rdquo; They sneak through corridors searching for keys and treasures.

However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&#10;&#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&#10;&#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&#10;&#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose.

Also, if the die roller doesn't act fast enough to cover all figures who needed to be trapped in the cup on the roll of 1 or 6, he has to pay 1 token to each other player and pass the die cup to the next player, who the acts as the die roller until he misses to cover a figure, and so on.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined when one player has reached a set amount of tokens, or one player has lost all tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, especially for young children, there are also colour-coded dice included, and instead of 1 or 6, two colours are determined when the game begins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="R"><div>R</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Resistance</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 5 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Science Fiction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Simultaneous Action Selection, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Empire must fall.

In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!&#10;&#10;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;Rule Correction:&#10;&#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Resistance: Avalon</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 5 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval, Negotiation, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Memory, Partnerships, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization.

In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&#10;&#10;1. SKIRMISH&#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&#10;&#10;2. DOMINION&#10;Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.&#10;&#10;3. WORLD AT WAR&#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&#10;&#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/robo-rally" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Robo Rally</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.18</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1994</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Miniatures, Racing, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Partnerships, Player Elimination, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Imagine that you're a supercomputer. Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180198/rolling-america" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Rolling America</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Number, Puzzle</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &quot;guard&quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &quot;dupe&quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round.

Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over.

Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.&#10;&#10;The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.&#10;&#10;Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.&#10;&#10;Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;&#10;&#10;During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.&#10;&#10;Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.&#10;&#10;As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate, the Constable chooses someone to potentially save, and the Spy chooses a Tryal card to look at. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.&#10;&#10;Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158900/samurai-spirit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Samurai Spirit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.87</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> You and your fellow samurai companions are the only standing obstacle between one frightened village and a full horde of blood-thirsty villains. The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&#10;&#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?&#10;&#10;Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &mdash; all of this is up to you!

It was designed to get a party started as quickly as possible by prompting people to talk about interesting things and to make ridiculous statements. If you are looking for great social interaction and lots of laughs, then you will probably enjoy playing Say Anything.&#10;&#10;History&#10;Say Anything was designed by Dominic Crapuchettes &amp; Satish Pillalamarri. It was first work-shopped by game designers at Protospiel 2004 and refined at Protospiel 2005, PowWow 2005, the GoF 2005 - 2007, and weekly game nights at the Looney Labs.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140795/say-bye-villains" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Say Bye to the Villains</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Say Bye to the Villains &ndash; a.k.a., &#230;&#136;&#144;&#230;&#149;&#151; (&quot;Punishment&quot;) in Japanese &ndash; is a cooperative card game in which players share information in limited ways to collectively defeat a villain who has harmed people in some manner.

But wait &ndash; these aren't the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it's too late?&#10;&#10;In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10; Reveals a rumor card.&#10; Attempts a quest.&#10; Accuses a knight.&#10;&#10;&#10;To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it's a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.&#10;&#10;Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &quot;It's time.&quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.&#10;&#10;Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan's forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur's kingdom falls.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10; Shadows over Camelot&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166443/sing-it" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Sing It!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.48</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Singing, Time Track</div><div><b>Description:</b> Are you ready for our grand lyrics competition?&#10;&#10;In the party game Sing it!, players draw a card, choose a word, and say the lyrics of the first song that comes to mind.

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&#10;&#10;All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.&#10;&#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&#10;&#10;You are a Sheep.&#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;&#10;&#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&#10;&#10;&#10; Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&#10; Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&#10; Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&#10;&#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game.

On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&#10;&#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173291/spit-it-out" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Spit It Out</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.51</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Think fast!

It's really simple!&#10;&#10;Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location &mdash; a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station &mdash; except that one player receives a card that says &quot;Spy&quot; instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!&#10;&#10;At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points. However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.&#10;&#10;After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178613/star-trek-five-year-mission" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Star Trek: Five Year Mission</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.45</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Star Trek: Five-Year Mission is a cooperative dice placement game for 3-7 players who take the roles of crew members of either the USS Enterprise (from the original Star Trek series) or the USS Enterprise-D (from Star Trek: The Next Generation).

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10; Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10; Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10; Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other. The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best. An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/169652/turbo-rally-card-racing-thunder-track" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Thunder Track</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> THUNDER TRACK takes careful planning, patience, wit, and a healthy dose of foresight to become a champion. Get too far ahead and you'll become everyone's target. Fall too far back and you might not be able to catch up by the end of the race. Waste all your RPMs and Ammo and you may not have them when you need them most. With plenty of surprises around every corner, only the driver who knows how to react quickly&mdash;and carefully&mdash;will head home with a trophy.&#10;&#10;Building on the platform established by Turbo Rally Card Racing, THUNDER TRACK introduces a whole new level of strategy into the mix! Using your own 1:64 scale die-cast cars, race opponents along rally themed card tracks that you create. The cards are expandable so you can challenge unlimited players and build courses as simple or as big as you can imagine.&#10;&#10;On your turn, flip one track card over, and follow the signs as you race through jumps and obstacles toward the finish line&mdash;all while fending off attacks from your opponents. The first player to reach the winner's circle wins one of five trophies&mdash;and an advantage in the next race!&#10;&#10;But don't think for a second that getting to the Winner's Circle is easy. With over 30 RPM (Radical Performance Maneuvers) cards that allow players to boost ahead, burst through obstacles or sabotage opponents, THUNDER TRACK shifts racing strategy into high gear. Whether it's smokescreens and straightaways or pit stops and pace notes, the right RPM combo at the right time will keep your foot on the gas and your opponents off-track.&#10;&#10;If tire spikes and land mines can&rsquo;t seem to keep your fellow racers from taking the top spot in the winner&rsquo;s circle, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re also introducing 10 different weapons to choose from. Send your opponents skidding off track with a missile attack or drag them into the dirt and leave them stranded with a well-aimed grappling hook. But, whichever weapon you choose, you&rsquo;ll have access to unique special abilities and features sure to keep your opponents eating your dust.&#10;&#10;Think you've got what it takes to be a Turbo Rally Card Racing Champion?

When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only her first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154498/till-dawn" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Till Dawn</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Horror</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Don't get caught in the sun!&#10;&#10; Till Dawn, a 20&ndash;30-minute game for 4-8 vampires (or 12, with the expansion), takes place over the course of three nights during which time all self respecting vampires leave their coffins to hunt.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124172/tsuro-seas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Tsuro of the Seas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Route/Network Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &mdash; that is, keep on the game board &mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/134352/two-rooms-and-boom" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Two Rooms and a Boom</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 6 - 30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Two Rooms and a Boom &ndash; a social deduction/hidden role party game for six or more players &ndash; there are two teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Watson &amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &#10;Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&ntilde;ar&aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&oacute;n de una serie de casos in&eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&oacute;n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber&aacute; sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra&iacute;das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l&oacute;gica deductiva.&#10;&#10;Y, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu&eacute;l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar&aacute; la confianza del genio de Baker Street.&#10;&#10;El juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu&aacute;les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar&aacute; de resolver antes que los dem&aacute;s.&#10;Para ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder&aacute;n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci&oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.&#10;Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes. Hecho esto, se devolver&aacute;n las cartas de pista a su lugar para que los dem&aacute;s puedan leerla en rondas posteriores.&#10;Este procedimiento se repetir&aacute; cada ronda, hasta que un jugador crea haber hallado la soluci&oacute;n al caso: en ese momento, habr&aacute; de dirigirse al 221B para comprobar si sus respuestas son acertadas.&#10;En caso de ser todas correctas, habr&aacute; ganado. En caso de error, habr&aacute; perdido y se retirar&aacute; de la partida.&#10;Cada detective contar&aacute;, adem&aacute;s, con la inestimable ayuda de una serie de aliados de Sherlock Holmes, as&iacute; como con la del propio detective y, sobre todo, la del buen Dr. Watson.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42448/we-didnt-playtest-either" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>We Didn&#39;t Playtest This Either</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the box:&#10;&#10;Many will enter, some will win.

Unable to determine who amongst themselves are werewolves, they've called in a group of master inquisitors to help sort out this mess before it's too late. That's where you and your team come in. No stranger to werewolf infestations, you know that the best thing to do is to start lynching suspects.&#10;&#10;You no sooner get started on this project when you discover that there's a problem &ndash; Werewolves have also infiltrated your team of inquisitors! Now you're in a serious pickle: You need to save the village while thwarting the werewolves whom are working alongside you...&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition is a standalone game of deduction, secrets and betrayal with no elimination. Part of the fun is figuring out who the werewolves are on your team, but even then, you've still got to outsmart them!&#10;&#10;More specifically, the humans need to rid the town of werewolves in order to win, while the werewolf players need to eliminate human villagers so that the werewolves can overrun the town. To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident &ndash; but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round. Who will live? Who will die?

Fuelled by hate and fear, Winter aims at extinguishing the flame of Love and the light of Hope under a blanket of snow and the never-ending chill of a winter night. In the winding alleys and the small houses desperately clinging to the hillside of Wintertown, frightened Tales move in the shadows, knowing they cannot allow all Hope for the future to be snuffed out by the cold and ready to fight to drive Winter away and let Spring come again.&#10;&#10;In Winter Tales, a storytelling board game, players tell the tale of the conflict between the characters of fairy tales, who represent all that is good and hopeful, and the Soldiers of Winter, who incarnate evil and the fierce cold of Winter. Players will ally themselves with one of the warring Factions, controlling characters and fighting for the comeback of Spring or the suffocation of all hope, bringing on an endless Winter.&#10;&#10;Winter Tales is an ever-changing game as each time the players will tell a completely different story, creating a shared plot.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Wits and Wagers</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.01</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 25 - 25</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game, Trivia</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Not a trivia buff?

Push your luck to eat their brains, but stop rolling before the shotgun blasts end your turn! Whoever collects 13 brains first wins. Each game takes 10 to 20 minutes and can be taught in a single round.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you take three dice from the box and roll them. A brain symbol is worth one point at the end of the round, while footsteps allow you to reroll this particular dice. Shotgun blasts on the other hand are rather bad, cause if you collect three shotgun blasts during your turn, it is over for you and you get no points. After rolling three dice, you may decide if you want to score your current brain collection or if you want to push your luck by grabbing new dice so you have three again and roll once more.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
