A player can take a card only if it&#39;s not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player can win 7 Wonders: Duel in one of three ways. Each time that you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent&#39;s capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions. If you reach the opponent&#39;s capital, you win the game immediately. Similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If neither of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FAQ: About the yellow buildings: &amp;quot;Starting on the following turn, you will purchase the indicated resource from the bank at the cost of 1 coin per unit&amp;quot; means exactly what it says.

For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower. As the game progresses you add to your selection of cards, increasing the range of actions available to you. There are many strategies to be explored.

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &amp;quot;ice&amp;quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation&#39;s virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It&#39;s not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort&#39;s defenses, there&#39;s no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104955/antike-duellum" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Antike Duellum</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.24</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 75 - 75</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Civilization, Fighting, Nautical, Territory Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Antike Duellum &amp;ndash; previewed at Spiel 2011 under the name Casus Belli &amp;ndash; is a two-player strategy game based on modified rules from Mac Gerdts&#39; Antike.

The first player to earn ten victory points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The challenge of this game is winning as Batman. You must use cunning, strategy, and excellent timing to win. If you are having trouble winning as Batman, we suggest you use a house rule that allows Batman to draw 2 Combat Cards at the end of his turn, instead of just 1.

The side with the highest &#39;formation&#39; of cards wins the flag.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards. Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an &amp;quot;advanced variant&amp;quot;. Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.

Each card allows a player to play the components shown on it, with the wall deck cards always depicting at least one wall (and some combination of walls/towers) and the tower deck cards always depicting at least one tower (and again some combination of walls/towers). On a turn, a player can play as many cards as she wants, but she draws only one card at the end of her turn. The goal is to create courtyards &amp;ndash; and subdivide existing courtyards &amp;ndash; while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Players have the same cards in their decks, so the challenge is all about what to use when. The game ends when all the castle pieces are used up, and the player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two different pairs of Keep colors are available in the two versions of Castellan, so with two copies of the game &amp;ndash; and the right combination of bits &amp;ndash; up to four players can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36932/claustrophobia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Claustrophobia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.64</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Horror, Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Claustrophobia is a miniatures-based dungeon crawl game set within the universe of Hell Dorado.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The box contains pre-painted miniatures which are placed on large tiles showing the dungeon spaces.

The game is about managing decisions and choosing what to do with the resources that you have, managing difficult events and out-thinking your opponent.

One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &amp;ldquo;Fate&amp;rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&amp;rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&amp;rsquo;s specific &amp;ldquo;Objective&amp;rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&amp;rsquo;s board edge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &amp;quot;Actions&amp;quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &amp;quot;Events&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; both good and bad &amp;mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&amp;rsquo;s perfect plan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp;amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill (Hasbro), Commands &amp;amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2961/confusion-espionage-and-deception-cold-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Confusion: Espionage and Deception in the Cold War</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.16</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1992</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Bluffing, Deduction, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Grid Movement, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> A strategic two-player abstract with a heavy deduction element.

Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp;amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp;amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon&#39;s shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &amp;quot;melee attack&amp;quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36235/duke" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Duke</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.63</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Grid Movement, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Levy. Maneuver. Conquer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture &amp;ndash; often considered to be defensive or offensive &amp;ndash; and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent&#39;s tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent&#39;s tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent&#39;s Duke to win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With fifteen different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and nineteen total pieces for each player (plus special optional tiles), the variety of game play is limitless.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board. These rules also include several alternate objectives, such as the challenging Dark Rider game which pits five Pikeman against a lone Knight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="E"><div>E</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/403/elk-fest" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Elk Fest</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.19</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1999</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Animals, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Modular Board</div><div><b>Description:</b> Part of the Kosmos two-player series, Elk Fest or Elchfest is a two player dexterity game in which players attempt to navigate their moose across a river along a series of stones.

It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &amp;mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends in one of three ways:&amp;#10;- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately&amp;#10;- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)&amp;#10;- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500. If there are no black cattle (because the Byrd player has them, or through drought) then they are worth nothing. The player with the highet total wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a players turn, they choose a colour of longhorn present in their location and steal all of that colour. For each longhorn stolen, the player moves the player piece that many spaces and then flips it, to signify that it is now the other player&#39;s turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a location is cleared of longhorn cattle, the player who took the last longhorn must take the token present and activate it. Some are positive and some are negative. Once a space is cleared, it can not be moved to in a future turn, though it can be moved through.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Lost Cities: The Card Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.13</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1999</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&amp;ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &amp;quot;handshakes&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;HS&amp;quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &amp;quot;couples&amp;quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player&#39;s turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &amp;times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &amp;times;2 for the multiplier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="M"><div>M</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/101721/mage-wars-arena" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Mage Wars</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.92</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death?

Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &amp;ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &amp;quot;zones&amp;quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &amp;ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &amp;ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.&amp;#10; The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he&#39;ll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.&amp;#10; The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He&#39;s also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.&amp;#10; The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She&#39;ll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Extra copies of spells available with:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1&amp;#10; Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17396/manoeuvre" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Manoeuvre</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.31</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Napoleonic, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Campaign / Battle Card Driven, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Manoeuvre is a fast-playing game of battlefield command, set in the early 19th century.

The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the &#39;identity card&#39;) on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &amp;quot;potion&amp;quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you&#39;re trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card &#39;transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Add in one more gavel card type (&#39;work in lab&#39;) which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing.

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &amp;mdash; the currency/points in the game &amp;mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch&#39;s location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You&#39;re free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn&#39;t overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player&#39;s time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent&#39;s time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &amp;quot;button income&amp;quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&#39;s more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn&#39;t happen in every game.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board.

But I&#39;ll tell you what - after hearin&#39; this here stupefyin&#39; story I&#39;m about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The year is 1892.&amp;#10;The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed.&amp;#10;Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty&#39;s gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town.&amp;#10;Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he&#39;d steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man&#39;s eyes - and his gang to justice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang&#39;s deck: Cherokee Scout, &amp;quot;Adios, Amigoes!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma&#39;am&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Colonel player&#39;s objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &amp;quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;He shot my hat clean off!&amp;quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &amp;quot;Fire at will, boys.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he&#39;s free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he&#39;s as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as &#39;coming-into-play&#39; effects, and if a gringo has &#39;True Grit&#39;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It&#39;s War.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory Conditions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &amp;quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.&amp;#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.&amp;#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character&#39;s deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &amp;quot;Kittens&amp;quot; Mackenzie&#39;s case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128733/revolver-2-last-stand-malpaso" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Revolver 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> American West, Bluffing, Card Game, Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> In 1894, farmers from the small village of Malpaso face the prospect of again losing their livelihood to a band of roving thieves, led by the self-styled &amp;quot;General&amp;quot; Mapache &amp;ndash; himself wanted by the Mexican National Defense Army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Their solution is to go to the much admired but fallen from grace &amp;quot;Padre&amp;quot; Esteban, and see whether he can hire gunfighters to protect them. After trying to raise funds by any means at the &amp;quot;All Rivers&amp;quot; Poker tournament, the Padre recruits a band of gunslingers for the task and, once complete, travels back to the village over the precipitous Los Quantos bridge &amp;ndash; all the while harassed by a detachment of the General&#39;s men. There they fortify Malpaso itself, and usher the frightened villagers into the abandoned silver mine for protection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the bandits finally attack, both sides are prepared. Mapache&#39;s men unleashing their Gatling gun to devastating effect, while the villagers have a few tricks of their own. Both sides will suffer many casualties in the calamitous battle, but will the Mexican Army arrive in time to put an end to the bloodshed?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Revolver 2: Last Stand at Malpaso is a two-player card game set in the Old West, in which one player takes the role of General Mapache and his band of thieving outlaws, and the other player controls the villagers and guardians hired to protect the town of Malpaso, led by the infamous Padre Esteban. Each player has a unique deck of cards with unique possibilities as well as different winning conditions, which requires different tactics and different methods of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More than just new locations, Revolver 2 features brand new gameplay elements in players can use a mine cart-mounted Gatling gun, blow up a bridge, assemble their own team of gunfighters, and dynamite mine tunnels. The game also includes a terrific Stud Poker mini-game which determines in which town the initial firefights occur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Like the original Revolver, the game remains elegantly simple and can be learned in five minutes. That said, Revolver 2 is a standalone game and the cards from Revolver and its expansions (red packaging) are not interchangable with Revolver 2 and its expansions (green packaging).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136000/rivet-wars-eastern-front" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Rivet Wars</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.34</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Miniatures, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Rivet Wars is a miniatures boardgame that springs forth from the warped imagination of Ted Terranova - set on a world that never quite left World War I but with crazy technology like walking tanks, diesel powered armor, unicycled vehicles and armor plated cavalry!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Don&#39;t let the cute visuals fool you, it&#39;s a world full of angst, war-torn camaraderie and dark humor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rivet Wars is at its heart a strategy game, with both players deploying units each round to counter the threats set forth by their opponent and stay one tactical step ahead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heavily influenced by Ted&#39;s experience working on RTS games like Rise of Nations, players gather resources (bunkers and capture points) and use these to deploy streams of new units!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There&#39;s an ebb and flow on the tactical landscape and you can stock up surprises for your opponent to be unleashed even as he thinks he&#39;s winning!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201/rose-king" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Rose King</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.80</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1997</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Grid Movement, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&amp;ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series.

It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Factions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Trade Federation&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&amp;rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&amp;rsquo;s trade and other interests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;The Blobs&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &amp;ldquo;The Blobs&amp;rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Star Empire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Machine Cult&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Playing Star Realms&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Authority directly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&amp;rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&amp;rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&amp;rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&amp;rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160964/star-wars-empire-vs-rebellion" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.57</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Deck / Pool Building, Hand Management, Memory, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Claim victory in the Galactic Civil War in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, a fast-paced card game for two players. In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&amp;rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&amp;rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&amp;rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can&#39;t use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2338/starship-catan" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Starship Catan</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.86</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2001</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Exploration, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Memory, Press Your Luck, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> Starship Catan is a two-player card game that is thematically similar to Starfarers of Catan, but has different game play.

Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that&#39;s triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally.

Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers, and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the invader manages to break into the castle before the end of seven rounds, they win; otherwise the defender wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This second edition of Stronghold features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Ten objective cards for the invader and ten hidden defense plan cards for the defender; each objective encourages the invader to consider a particular move, while each defense plan shows the defender different ways to surprise the invader&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Shorter gameplay than the first edition, with attackers being placed on the board during set-up&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Gameplay limited to two players only, replacing the team rules in the first edition&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Streamlined rules and an enhanced rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Improved components, such as a larger game board and new, drab, brown artwork&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="T"><div>T</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161742/tacdex-halo" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">TacDex: Halo</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.95</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> TacDex: Halo uses gameplay similar to well-known card game War, with players revealing cards simultaneously to try to claim cards owned by the opponent, but a battle marker determines whether a high or low card wins a particular battle and players each have special action cards to add new twists to the conflict.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161743/tacdex-pirates" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">TacDex: Pirates</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.49</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Fighting, Pirates</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> TacDex: Pirates uses gameplay similar to well-known card game War, with players revealing cards simultaneously to try to claim cards owned by the opponent, but a battle marker determines whether a high or low card wins a particular battle and players each have special action cards to add new twists to the conflict.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173572/tacdex-super-mario" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">TacDex: Super Mario</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.94</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Children&#39;s Game, Fighting, Video Game Theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> From the box: Players duel to the finish while the Battle Marker determines if high or low card wins each battle.

Kennedy&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler&#39;s war machine, while humanity&#39;s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &amp;quot;superpowers&amp;quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT&#39;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one&#39;s cards and units given consistently limited resources?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Twilight Struggle&#39;s Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components (original edition):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; 228 full colour counters &amp;#10; 22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot; full colour map &amp;#10; 103 event cards &amp;#10; 2 six-sided dice&amp;#10; 1 24-page rulebook&amp;#10; 2 full colour player aid cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&amp;#10;&amp;#10; 260 full colour counters &amp;#10; 22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot; mounted map with revised graphics&amp;#10; 110 event cards&amp;#10; 2 six-sided dice&amp;#10; 1 24-page rulebook&amp;#10; 2 full colour player aid cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TIME SCALE: approx. 3-5 years per turn&amp;#10;MAP SCALE: Point-to-point system&amp;#10;UNIT SCALE: Influence markers&amp;#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1 - 2&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp;amp; Jason Matthews&amp;#10;MAP, CARD, &amp;amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Mounted map with revised graphics&amp;#10; Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&amp;#10; Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&amp;#10; Revised rules and player aid cards&amp;#10; Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Mounted Map with revised graphics&amp;#10; New card decks&amp;#10; Updated Rules &amp;amp; Charts&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="U"><div>U</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34969/ubongo-duel" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Ubongo Duel</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.92</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Puzzle, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Now, Ubongo goes two-player!

Both players lay the puzzle tiles down in front of them. Rolling the 20 sided die determines which of the tiles are used in the specific rounds. The players then try to solve every puzzle sheet as quickly as possible by laying the appropriate tiles on it. The faster player to do this yells &#39;Ubongo!&#39;.

It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMPONENTS:&amp;#10;The game includes 11 dice. Each die is unique and has some combination of faces in the four UNO colors (yellow, green, blue and red). The die faces include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, draw one, draw two, and wild (in black). Note that there are no die faces that represent the Skip or Reverse cards from the original UNO card game (presumably because this is just a 2 player game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY:&amp;#10;The game mechanic is simple and mimics the original UNO card game. To begin, 5 dice are randomly given to each of the two players. These dice take the place of a players hand of cards in the original UNO card game. The 11th die is left in the middle of the play area to form the start of the dice line (think UNO discard stack from the original card game). The starting player rolls their dice and has to match either the color or value of the most recently placed die in the dice line. That player&#39;s matching die is placed in the dice line and will have to be matched by the next player. Play continues as players take turns rolling their hand of dice and adding one matching die from their hand to the dice line each turn until they only have one die left in their hand. The player must then say &amp;quot;UNO!&amp;quot; or be penalized. The penalty for not remembering to say &amp;quot;UNO!&amp;quot; is similar to the draw one and draw two die faces: the affected player must take the appropriate number of dice from the end of the dice line. The first player with no dice left wins. The winning player&#39;s score is based on the faces of the dice left in front of their opponent. Alternate rules are provided to ignore scoring and simply play the best out of 3 games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PACKAGING:&amp;#10;This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label. The top of the can pops off (twist to open). The one sheet of rules and 11 dice fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin. The tin also has a coin slot in the top that holds the a plastic hook to allow it to be hung for selling/display purposes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="V"><div>V</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128698/vampire-empire" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Vampire Empire</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.88</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> In a foreboding castle somewhere in central Europe, a strange fear has descended upon the inhabitants.

Before the truth will be discovered, more than one person may face unjust accusations thrown out by the devious servants of darkness. Will the vampires be successfully caught before they endanger the entire society, or will the castle and city fall forever into darkness?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three characters in the castle are vampires. A human investigator is trying to determine which three of nine characters he encounters are, in fact, monsters hiding in human form so that he can eliminate them. The head vampire, on the other hand, must bluff cleverly, present confusing clues, and trick the humans into attacking innocent citizens. By doing this, the vampire can kill the most important characters in the city or conquer the castle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vampire Empire is a two-player card game with a lot of bluffing and player interaction.

Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet&#39;s assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you&#39;ll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &amp;mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent&#39;s warlord is another way to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="Y"><div>Y</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43022/yomi" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle">Yomi</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.19</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 2</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yomi is the Japanese word for &amp;ldquo;reading&amp;rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game&#39;s title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &amp;ldquo;guess&amp;rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &amp;quot;just random,&amp;quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Yomi (second edition)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</div></div></div></body></html>
