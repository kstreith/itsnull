One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has 'no chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.&#10;&#10;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&#10;&#10;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/423/1856" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>1856</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1995</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 300 - 300</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Route/Network Building, Stock Holding, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>7 Wonders</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Civilization</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="A"><div>A</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Acquire</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.36</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1964</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Stock Holding, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.

Defeat a great Dungeon Guardian and you could gain riches beyond imagination. Will you answer the call?&#10;&#10;Adventure IN! invites you and up to 4 more Adventurers to explore dungeons in the quest to find treasures and brag about your exploits!&#10;&#10;As you journey you will stumble upon Encounters, cards featuring some sort of creature or hazard. You typically must defeat at least two in order to face the Guardian of the Treasure Horde, the ultimate Encounter! Each time an Encounter is defeated* you level up, gaining the ability to use more powerful Treasures, such as items which heal and grant special abilities, and equipment and weapons that boost your abilities.&#10;&#10;Adventure IN is two games in one! The base game is a quick, competitive Tournament through a randomly selected Dungeon. The first Adventurer, or Adventurers, to reach and defeat the Dungeon Guardian will be victorious. You may choose to cooperate at strategic points in the game, especially at the final Encounter where you may have to choose between winning with a friend or losing to your opponents. To add variety, Adventure IN also includes a fully cooperative Campaign. In the Campaign, you and the other players work together to try and beat a series of Dungeons. Each Dungeon has a unique layout, usually requiring that you defeat several Encounters before facing the Dungeon Guardian. This mode offers more strategy and depth, but also takes longer to play.&#10;&#10;The Game features multiple Dungeons, various character combinations and a large variety of Treasures and other rewards that augment character abilities.

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.&#10;&#10;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill. Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency. Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency. With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&#10;&#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&#10;&#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market. The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.

The primary module is &quot;The Vizier's Favor&quot;, which allows players to buy a building out of turn but has to be paid with exact amount.&#10;&#10;2. &quot;The Builders Huts&quot; (Die Bauh&uuml;tte) introduces a number of new tiles that only count in the scoring when other tiles of the same color are built next to them. Hut tiles are free, but their number is limited to three per player.&#10;&#10;3. With the &quot;The Currency Exchange&quot; (Wechselstube), players can buy building tiles by mixing different currencies.&#10;&#10;4. The fourth module is a set of bonus cards that are dealt to the players. Each of the tiles shows a particular building. If the matching building is part of your Alhambra, then the bonus card can be revealed and will count as another building of that category.&#10;&#10;About Granada, also called as Alhambra Advanced: it is a standalone game the players develop the city of Granada next to Sierra Nevada, where the famous Alhambra stands, by buying building tiles to construct the city which will earn the most victory points. Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25491/alhambra-dice-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Alhambra: Dice Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.17</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2006</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Arabian, Dice</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Member of the Alhambra, and a stand-alone game with the same box-size as Alhambra.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to get the most victory points. The game goes over five rounds giving a scoring after the 1st, 3rd and 5th round. Victory points are awarded for majorities of allocated buildings (very similar to the original game Alhambra). To get the buildings you roll 8 dice each showing the six building-symbols. Each player has 3 rolls on his turn to get as many similar symbols as possible (up to a max of 8). A player can only note his result for one type of building. The results of the dice rolls from every player is marked on the game board. So everybody can compare his dice rolls with those of the other players. After a round is completed the player with the highest dice-roll can choose between 2 buildings of the respective category or 1 building and a special counter giving a certain bonus. (Bonuses can be: additional 1-3 VPs, extra dice-roll, exchange one building, determine Starting player, etc.) The second best player in that category will get the other part. Each round has a certain number of turns depending on how many players are playing (3, 4 or 5 turns). So, because a player can only hit one type of building during his turn, he cannot score all 6 types of buildings in a single round. After round #1, #3 and #5 the majority in each building category is awarded the same way like in Alhambra. The player with the most VP's wins the game.&#10;&#10;Special: There is a variant in which you can combine the building counters of the Alhambra game which adds some building strategy.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10; Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170318/among-stars-revival" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Among the Stars: Revival</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Simultaneous Action Selection, Tile Placement, Variable Phase Order</div><div><b>Description:</b> A new era has begun.

Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &quot;come on&quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.&#10;&#10;The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &quot;Office Map&quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location.

The proposal will affect five issues &ndash; military, currency, etc. &ndash; in various ways, and each player has a secret document for the round that tells him how a change in each issue will affect him. All players openly negotiate on what they need in terms of points and bribes in order to vote for that proposal.&#10;&#10;After at most five minutes, the Secretary General closes negotiations by banging his wooden gavel, then players vote yes or no on the proposal.

Carefully planning the chain of cards that you will play during the game turn is the key to success.&#10;&#10;Artificium lasts four turns. At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players' individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player's coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins). The player with the most victory points is considered to be the wisest medieval ruler and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165798/auge-um-auge" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Auge um Auge</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 4.40</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Auge um Auge (&quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;), each player controls a six-member gang that wants to hand out eight black eyes before any other gang can do so.&#10;&#10;In the dice brawls that take place, any gang can support any other &mdash; but of course each gang is interested only in its own victory, so don't rely too much on the support of others.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth.

Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up.

You are a world-renowned master city planner who has been asked to redesign two different cities. Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with a partner with whom to discuss and execute your grandiose plans. Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive city in the world?&#10;&#10;Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city. On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability. Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities. The player with the highest final score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game features play for 3-7 players in 20-25 minutes, a 2-player variant for head-to-head competition as well as a solo variant (Automa).&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148282/black-hat" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Black Hat</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.55</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Set Collection, Trick-taking</div><div><b>Description:</b> Information wants to be free, but you charge by the hour...&#10;&#10;In the world of network security, a &quot;black hat&quot; is a hacker who defeats computer systems for personal gain.

Disguised by a secret identity, they try to kidnap the Elder of the opposing clan or give their lives for the benefit of their own Elder. Malicious attacks, aimed indiscretions, and assistance from others will slowly uncover the truth: Who fights for whom? And who is the Elder?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player knows three things:&#10;&#10;&#10; Who he is and to which clan he belongs&#10; That a few other players are his allies, while everyone else is the enemy of both him and his clan&#10; The clan to which one of his neighbors belongs &ndash; although some characters can lie about their clan identity&#10;&#10;&#10;Now the players have to figure out who the Elder of the opposing team is (if there is one) and capture him. To do this, players need to attack, negotiate and deduce, with an attacked player being required to reveal information, such as his rank or clan affiliation. Each player has an ability unique to his character, and this ability can be used only at the moment that he reveals his rank. The Assassin forces players to suffer wounds, for example, while the Guardian protects a player of the character's choice.&#10;&#10;In the end, if you capture your rival clan's Elder, you win &ndash; but if you capture the wrong vampire, you've fallen into the enemy's trap and lose the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11/bohnanza" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Bohnanza</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.08</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1997</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Farming, Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them.

The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&#10;&#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/114438/wait-theres-more" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>But Wait, There&#39;s More!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.08</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Have you ever wanted a glass, that stops messy accidents before they happen, or pants, that provide relief at the touch of a button?

The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.&#10;&#10;Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a &quot;Bang!&quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table &mdash; money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a &quot;Bang!&quot; card to your hand) &mdash; until everything has been claimed.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175150/casting" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Casting</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.56</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> Each round in Casting, one player is a director who's looking for comedians for her next movie, while the other players are agents who want to promote their own client.

You can get this information during the game either by trading objects with other players, because every object has a special ability, e.g. &quot;Trade it in and you may take a look at your trading partners-association.&quot; or by struggling with other players, because the winner of a struggle can view the cards of the underdog and steal one of them.

Kairn (200 copies) was designed and self-published by Daniel Quodbach in 2010. Blackrock Editions and Scorpion Masque produced 1000 copies of Kairn and released it at Essen in 2011. Gryphon Games version of the game has yet to be produced, pending the conclusion of a current Kickstarter campaign that was organized to gauge demand for its version. Caveman Curling is scheduled for mass production in January, 2012, and to be released in late February, 2012. The first and only production copy of the Gryphon version will arrive in the US on December 14, 2011 and a video will be made showing the differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102794/caverna-cave-farmers" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Caverna</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.23</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 210</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Economic, Fantasy, Farming</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Tile Placement, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175117/celestia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Celestia</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Aviation / Flight, Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Celestia, a revamped version of Cloud 9, you board an aircraft with a team of adventurers to perform many trips through the cities of Celestia and recover their wonderful treasures.

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10; Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10; Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147151/concept" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Concept</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.04</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 12</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Concept, your goal is to guess words through the association of icons.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...&#10;&#10;In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:&#10;&#10;&#10; Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.&#10; Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.&#10; Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.&#10; Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10; Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:&#10;&#10;&#10; Income: Take one coin from the treasury.&#10; Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.&#10; Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.&#10;&#10;&#10; Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck.

The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!&#10;&#10;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&#10;&#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&#10;&#10;Roles&#10;&#10;Forensic Scientist x1&#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime.

Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Investigators x8&#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&#10;&#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.&#10;&#10;Accomplice x1&#10;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.&#10;&#10;Witness x1&#10;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.&#10;&#10;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/152162/diamonds" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Diamonds</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.05</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Trick-taking</div><div><b>Description:</b> Diamonds is a trick-taking card game in which players collect Diamonds &mdash; not cards bearing that suit, mind you, but rather actual &quot;Diamond Crystals&quot; (acrylic crystals) included in the game.&#10;&#10;What makes the game of Diamonds different from other trick-taking card games is that when you cannot follow suit you get a &quot;Suit Action&quot; based on what suit you do play.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. &#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10; Dominant Species: The Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162107/doodle-city" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Doodle City</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.37</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Line Drawing, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Doodle City is a quick family game of city building. By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&#10;&#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&#10;&#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution.

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168/empire-builder" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Empire Builder</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.92</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1982</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 180</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Trains, Transportation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Area Enclosure, Crayon Rail System, Pick-up and Deliver, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Epic Railroad Building in North America&#10;&#10;Discover a modern North American classic.

Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173442/empires-age-discovery" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Empires: Age of Discovery</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.29</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 50 - 150</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Exploration, Renaissance</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Empires: Age of Discovery allows you to revisit the age of exploration and discovery.

The villages, now faced with destruction, must do whatever they can to protect their homes from the incoming surge of lava.&#10;&#10;Your village is about to burn up &mdash; can you take the heat?&#10;&#10;Eruption is a competitive survival game in which each player struggles to save his or her own village from destruction caused by an onslaught of lava from an erupting volcano. As lava enters a village, its temperature increases until it has burned up completely. Players can protect their own villages by placing lava tiles defensively and strategically building walls of various materials to hold back the lava. They are also rewarded with action cards for directing lava to other villages. Action cards allow players to rotate, replace, or remove the hexagonal lava tiles as well as cool down and fortify their own villages. Once the volcano has fully unleashed its fury, the player whose village is at the lowest temperature wins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133848/euphoria-build-better-dystopia" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Euphoria</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.39</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> UPDATE July 1, 2014: 16 of the original recruit cards have been updated and revised for the second printing of Euphoria. Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?&#10;&#10;Official Rules: http://stonemaiergames.com/rules-euphoria/&#10;Microbadges:&#10;&#10; Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia fan&#10;&#10; Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia fan&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Evolution</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.32</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 50 - 70</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Animals, Card Game, Educational, Environmental, Prehistoric, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Hand Management, Press Your Luck, Secret Unit Deployment, Simulation, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&#10;&#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules. The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table. Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players. Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business. Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory. And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting. So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&#10;&#10;&quot;The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.&quot; - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal) &#10;Evolution was covered in the journal, Nature.

In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread. Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&#10;&#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.' These items are all still available directly from Academy Games.&#10;&#10;This game is the most recent edition of Fief. It re-implements: &#10;&#10; Fief (first original edition, 1981)&#10; Fief 2 (second edition with updated rules, 1989)&#10; Fief (third edition with completely revised rules and material, 2011)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Flash Point Fire Rescue: 2nd Edition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.32</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Pick-up and Deliver, Simulation, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> The call comes in... &quot;911, what is your emergency?&quot; On the other end is a panicked response of &quot;FIRE!&quot; Moments later you don the protective suits that will keep you alive, gather your equipment and rush to the scene of a blazing inferno.

You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.&#10;&#10;Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game.&#10;In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.&#10;As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building. Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles. If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose. Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.&#10;&#10;The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&#10;&#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&#10;&#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&#10;&#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10; A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&#10; A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10; A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)&#10; A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&#10; A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141430/geek-out" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Geek Out!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.86</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Party Game, Trivia</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Geek Out! is a party game that can determine once and for all which player is the most knowledgeable about your favorite pop culture subjects!&#10;&#10;In the game, you draw cards asking you to list a certain number of things which fall under a certain category: comic books, fantasy, games, science fiction, and miscellaneous.

That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!&#10;&#10;Get Bit! is a card game in which the player pirates find themselves in the ocean, competing to stay alive as others are being eaten by a shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face down, then revealing the values.

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history. Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch. The game board is a stylized version of the globe. The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events. Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation. Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events. There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few). Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires. One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet. If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch. Then the next player draws and makes his decision. The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws. Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by). One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand. The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions. If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them). A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop). If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.&#10;&#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer. To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it. Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from. In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well. If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense. Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker. In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort. On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land. Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues. Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered). After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place. Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch. One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land). Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area). These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example). Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board. Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him. These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then. This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10; http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160968/homeland-game" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Homeland: The Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.94</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Memory, Secret Unit Deployment, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Homeland: The Game is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue, deception and hidden agendas.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&#10;&#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&#10;&#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&#10;&#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&#10;&#10;The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="I"><div>I</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115/im-boss" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>I&#39;m the Boss</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.84</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1994</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Negotiation</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Roll / Spin and Move, Set Collection, Take That</div><div><b>Description:</b> Classic negotiation game in which players take turns being &quot;The Boss&quot; arranging deals between specific players on how best to divide piles of money.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10; Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10; Illuminati: Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10; Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10; Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10; European Illuminati - New cards.&#10; &#10; The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10; Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10; &#10; Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10; Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37759/incan-gold" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Incan Gold</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2006</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Bluffing, Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice. Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165959/jolly-roger-game-piracy-mutiny" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Jolly Roger: The Game of Piracy &amp; Mutiny</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor, Negotiation, Pirates</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the card game Jolly Roger: The Game of Piracy &amp; Mutiny, you're a crew member aboard a pirate ship and have just elected a new captain. This man will lead you toward either fortune or disaster &mdash; and thankfully no matter what course of action he takes, if you don't agree with his choices, you can always start a mutiny and become the next captain yourself...&#10;&#10;Each turn, the captain chooses a destination for the ship, a target that it will attack. Once the ship is attacking, the players (more or less!) co-operate to defeat their victim, then they divide the treasure amongst themselves &mdash; but your gold is never secure until you bury it on Treasure Island.&#10;&#10;As you carry out the attack, unrest is always brewing in the kettle. Each time the captain makes a choice, it's possible for one of the other players to call &quot;Mutiny&quot; and try to overthrow him to become the new captain. And when the mutiny begins, you need to decide how to use your cards during the mutiny and the looming battle. How much will you co-operate when you assault an enemy, and what will you keep to yourself to prepare for when the next mutiny starts?&#10;&#10;As is fitting for a pirate, your greatest desire is for gold, and you'll do anything to reach your goal.

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257/kill-doctor-lucky" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Kill Doctor Lucky Board Game</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1996</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Humor, Murder/Mystery</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Point to Point Movement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In this notorious game, an inversion of Clue, you hate Doctor Lucky.

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!&#10;&#10;King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&#10;&#10;What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &quot;Fame&quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&#10;&#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&#10;&#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>King of Tokyo</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.34</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack.

Anyone who can't stay competitive will be left with nothing but dust in their coffers!&#10;&#10;The process is simple: Factories produce the goods (machinery, textiles, chemicals, food, and luxuries) that are coveted by the city folk. Airships &ndash; forbidden from landing in the cities but capable of carrying cargo over great distances &ndash; must be used to gather those goods and deliver them to depots along the rail network.

Will you be the &quot;King of Air and Steam?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kings of Air and Steam spans five rounds, and at the beginning of each round, players plan their Airship flights using four of their movement cards. When everyone is ready, everyone reveals their first planned card. According to the turn order and movement limits of their cards, players move their Airships, then take an Action; Actions include Building Depots, Upgrading your Airship or Train, Shipping Goods by rail, and Soliciting Funds from the bank. When all players have acted, the second planned cards are revealed, and so on through the four planned cards until all players have finished carrying out their plans for the round. All the while, players must keep aware of the rising values of the different types of Goods and try to get the most-valuable Goods from the specialized factories that produce them to the cities that want them. At the end of the game, the player with the most money and the greatest shipping network will be declared King of Air and Steam!&#10;&#10;Kings of Air and Steam includes seven teams of characters, each with unique powers to give them a competitive edge, and a modular game board that makes each game a different experience.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="L"><div>L</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136280/la-boca" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>La Boca</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.03</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 40 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Partnerships, Pattern Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> La Boca, the most famous neighborhood in the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires, was populated by many Italian immigrants when first founded.

One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137649/level-7-omega-protocol" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Level 7 Omega Protocol</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.67</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting, Horror, Miniatures, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;LEVEL 7 [Omega Protocol] picks up right where LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE] left off. The Subterra Bravo facility has been thrown into chaos through the players actions in [ESCAPE], and now the government has sent in a top-secret, highly-trained special forces unit to shut down the facility and eliminate everything remaining in the base.&#10;&#10;In [Omega Protocol], one player takes on the role of the Overseer while two to five other players take on the role of the elite Special Ops team. The Overseer's role in the game is to control all of the alien denizens and challenges the players face throughout the game. The players are trying to achieve specific scenario-based objectives by exploring a map that's laid out at the start and fighting off the hordes of aliens that the Overseer sends their way.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is based around adrenaline, which is the currency that the soldier players use to perform actions. They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space. That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario. The more actions the Special Ops players take, the more resources the Overseer player has to work with.&#10;&#10;Characters in [Omega Protocol] are represented by miniatures, and each Special Ops and alien character has different attributes, powers, and customizable skills and equipment.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/45/liars-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Liar&#39;s Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.93</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1987</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Betting/Wagering, Dice Rolling, Player Elimination</div><div><b>Description:</b> Liar's Dice is a dice game where each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with.

Focusing only on increasing your popularity won't earn you any money, yet failing to spread your name won't make the rich or helpful guests come your way. &#10;It's a matter of deciding which characters (cards) will help you increase your popularity and which character cards you want to attract as guests. &#10;Once a player runs out of cards, the round is over, and all cards remaining in your hand become minus points, thus depleting your hand of cards quickly is important. Only the one who has attracted the richest guests (earned the most money) after three festival nights (rounds) will be the one who deserves to carry the title of &quot;Mai-Star&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game's setting is same as Master Merchant.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/99875/martian-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Martian Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.38</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Humor, Party Game, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your mission, Martians, is to swoop down on the pathetic denizens of the primitive planet Earth and scoop up as many of the inhabitants as you can manage.

The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible. Players start with a number of trains ringing the board. Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around. However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10; Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/590/mille-bornes" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Mille Bornes</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.67</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1954</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Take That</div><div><b>Description:</b> One Thousand Milestones.

The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/915/mystery-abbey" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Mystery of the Abbey</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.55</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1995</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Deduction, Medieval, Murder/Mystery, Religious</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Movement, Hand Management, Paper-and-Pencil, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit game with a twist.

It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each expansion increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.&#10;&#10;This first installment of Myths at War contains 300 cards split between the Nordic, Egyptian and Japanese mythologies (GDMI+GDM3 spanish editions). Each mythology includes two pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).&#10;&#10;Each player in Myths at War needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each expansion increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory but all expansions can be played on his own.&#10;&#10;During the game, each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="N"><div>N</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108044/nefarious" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Nefarious</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.49</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 45</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your genius could have been such a boon to humanity.

You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you. Archimedes once said, &quot;Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world.&quot; You will be the most terrifying lever the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Nefarious is a quick-playing game in which the players race to build inventions like a freeze ray, cloaking device, or robotic pet before their opponents can do the same. (Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)&#10;&#10;Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.&#10;&#10;There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time. This means that in order to win, the players will have to revise their strategies each time they play Nefarious.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66190/new-york" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>New York</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.64</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> City Building</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management, Set Collection, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> New York has the same game play as Dirk Henn&#226;&#128;&#153;s Spiel des Jahres-winning Alhambra, but with the Spanish architecture being replaced by the skyscrapers of Manhattan.

The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So!' to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra. Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&#10;&#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;&#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation. There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game. Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue. Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen). The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board. A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks. If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost. However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on. After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card. The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Al Capone A description of this version:&#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&#10;&#10;Other versions/re-themes:&#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game.

Managers collect what they are owed from investors, pay fees for each of their companies, and buy new companies at auction.&#10;&#10;After five rounds of play (5 months), the manager and the investor who have accumulated the most money are each declared victors, the undisputed masters of commerce.&#10;&#10;Panic on Wall Street! is the new edition of Masters of Commerce.

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.&#10;&#10;One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&#10;&#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166509/pinocchio-true-or-false" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Pinocchio: True or False</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.49</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Bluffing, Card Game, Comic Book / Strip, Negotiation, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Simulation, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Since Pinocchio has come to the Carpenter's house, the Carpenter is no longer lonely. However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&#10;&#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&#10;&#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&#10;&#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Pit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.42</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 1903</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Economic, Farming, Party Game, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> The original game was invented by Harry E.

If you're successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, &quot;Corner on wheat!&quot; (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others.

The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.&#10;&#10;Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.&#10;&#10;Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder. The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&rsquo;s rating for the current &ldquo;search&rdquo;. There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched. These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations. So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.&#10;&#10;Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn they draw an event card. These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city. Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime! These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur. Some of them have &ldquo;unknown circumstance&rdquo; tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.&#10;&#10;If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed. Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.&#10;&#10;So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.&#10;&#10;Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token. These tokens can later be used to help with tasks. However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances. The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for. If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.&#10;&#10;To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.

Each player gets a number of tokens, which act as victory points (see further below). &#10;The rest of the players now place their figures, which are attached to little ropes, onto the playing mat in the middle of the play area.

In case they pull their figure from the play area even if no 1 or 6 was rolled, they have to do the same. Also, if the die roller doesn't act fast enough to cover all figures who needed to be trapped in the cup on the roll of 1 or 6, he has to pay 1 token to each other player and pass the die cup to the next player, who the acts as the die roller until he misses to cover a figure, and so on.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined when one player has reached a set amount of tokens, or one player has lost all tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, especially for young children, there are also colour-coded dice included, and instead of 1 or 6, two colours are determined when the game begins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Power Grid</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.97</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2004</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Industry / Manufacturing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag.

However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;What's more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the &quot;renewable&quot; windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/151016/provincia-romana" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Provincia Romana</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.52</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Ancient, Card Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Hand Management</div><div><b>Description:</b> Provincia Romana is a game of strategy and urban development for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;As the leader of a Roman city in Gaul, you are responsible for its growth.

It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&#10;&#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &quot;mission&quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available. Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&#10;&#10;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas. Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&#10;&#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&#10;&#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10; Steam&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133633/rarrr" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Rarrr!!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.74</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 45 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Set Collection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In RARRR!!, players first draft monster power cards in order to build their perfect monster, then draft power bid cards to fuel their monsters' rampages through cities.

It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;Rule Correction:&#10;&#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Resistance: Avalon</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.78</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 5 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval, Negotiation, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Memory, Partnerships, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization.

In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&#10;&#10;1. SKIRMISH&#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&#10;&#10;2. DOMINION&#10;Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.&#10;&#10;3. WORLD AT WAR&#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&#10;&#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/634/river-dragons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>River Dragons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.47</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2000</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Point to Point Movement, Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board. An easy task! Or at least it would be if everyone were working together, but alas you're not.

The actions allow players to place plank foundations, place planks, move their pawns, cancel other players' actions, or remove planks or foundation stones. As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160434/robin" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Robin</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.97</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Medieval, Movies / TV / Radio theme</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Set Collection, Trading</div><div><b>Description:</b> In the fast-paced game Robin, you have just joined Robin Hood's merry men in Sherwood Forest.

Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180198/rolling-america" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Rolling America</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Number, Puzzle</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Paper-and-Pencil</div><div><b>Description:</b> Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &quot;guard&quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &quot;dupe&quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175549/salem" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Salem</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 12</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 25 - 35</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Accuse and defend your fellow townsfolk as you hunt down the witches of Salem. Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.&#10;&#10;The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.&#10;&#10;Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.&#10;&#10;Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;&#10;&#10;During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.&#10;&#10;Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.&#10;&#10;As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate, the Constable chooses someone to potentially save, and the Spy chooses a Tryal card to look at. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.&#10;&#10;Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158900/samurai-spirit" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Samurai Spirit</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.87</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Co-operative Play, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> You and your fellow samurai companions are the only standing obstacle between one frightened village and a full horde of blood-thirsty villains. The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&#10;&#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?&#10;&#10;Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &mdash; all of this is up to you! Ultimately it would be your honor to chose to die in a ultimate sacrifice in order to save the village. All of this is what makes the true samurai spirit!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128667/samurai-sword" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Samurai Sword</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.75</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 40</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Fighting, Medieval</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Samurai Sword is a game based on the proven Bang! mechanisms and set in feudal Japan.

Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it's too late?&#10;&#10;In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10; Reveals a rumor card.&#10; Attempts a quest.&#10; Accuses a knight.&#10;&#10;&#10;To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it's a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.&#10;&#10;Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &quot;It's time.&quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.&#10;&#10;Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan's forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur's kingdom falls.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10; Shadows over Camelot&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162619/siege-verdan" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Siege of Verdan</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 8.50</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 100 - 100</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Medieval, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Deck / Pool Building, Dice Rolling</div><div><b>Description:</b> Siege of Verdan is a military strategy game with aspects of area-control, diplomacy, resource management, and combat.

Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31503/slide-5" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Slide 5</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.54</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2007</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Number</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Simultaneous Action Selection</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players arrange their cards on the playing surface building &ldquo;hills.&rdquo; Once a hill gets five cards high, the sixth card will cause an &ldquo;Avalanche&rdquo; and that player must take all of the cards in the row, leaving the sixth card to start a new hill.

The mineral riches of the thriving Moon colony inspired legions of hearty Earth citizens to seek their fortunes in space. Humble rockets probed the farthest reaches of the solar system in an eager quest for resources, and brave colonists forged homes wherever they could survive. Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.&#10;&#10;Then the rumors began &mdash; whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures. By the time the secret invasion was exposed, the aliens were everywhere. Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!&#10;&#10;Thus was born the Rocket Patrol &ndash; an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.&#10;&#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions is a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.&#10;&#10;Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.&#10;&#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142079/space-cadets-dice-duel" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Space Cadets: Dice Duel</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.98</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Fighting, Real-time, Science Fiction, Space Exploration</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action / Movement Programming, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Partnerships</div><div><b>Description:</b> Your plan is quickly coming together.

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&#10;&#10;All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.&#10;&#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&#10;&#10;You are a Sheep.&#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;&#10;&#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&#10;&#10;&#10; Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&#10; Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&#10; Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&#10;&#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&#10;&#10;&#10; If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&#10; If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&#10;&#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/23637/spice-merchants" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Spice Merchants</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 0.00</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 0</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 0 - 0</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Travel</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Commodity Speculation, Pick-up and Deliver, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> A game of travel and trade set in the late 1500's and early 1600's.

Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!&#10;&#10;At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.

If you can outsmart your fellow pirates by using your brains and trading skills, you'll probably end up with the most valuable loot!&#10;&#10;Stingy is an interactive booty-swapping game for 2-6 players, with the booty in question being rum, parrots, coins, diamonds, and pirate flags; these first four items come in four colors, with 3-6 tiles of each item in those colors, while the pirate flags come only in black (as you might expect).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with six randomly drawn tiles, with the remainder of the tiles being scattered face down on the table or placed in the included pouch. On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it's impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.&#10;&#10;When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.&#10;&#10;After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &mdash; but only for the complete groups that they've collected. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &quot;Captain Sly&quot; variant in which an opponent who can't take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing. Good luck trying to make those unfair trades!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137550/story-war" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Story War</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.15</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Mythology, Party Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Storytelling</div><div><b>Description:</b> It&rsquo;s a card game for 3-to-8 players that combines storytelling and combat!

The aim in the game is to enlarge your fortune thanks to smart investments in rolling stock.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of investors who meet at the locomotive auction and try to buy the best of auctioned railway vehicles. Locomotive cards are not the only ones available for purchase though, because investors also compete for the most valuable railway wagons.&#10;&#10;The game is played for three rounds, each of which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the players bid locomotive cards. The auction type in each round is determined by drawing one of the six auction tokens. During the bidding of locomotive cards, the players should pay attention not only to its price, but also to the multiplier placed on the card (the higher, the greater the potential profits) as well as the locomotive speed. Once all the players have already purchased three locomotives, the second stage takes place. In this stage they are attaching wagons to their locomotives. They also make a choice: either to take one of the face-up wagon cards and attach to one of their locomotives, to pass and do not take any card, or to pay for replacing cards on the table and only then decide, whether to take one of the available wagons.&#10;&#10;The round is over when one of the locomotives of any player has its fifth wagon attached. Then, all the players are summing up the profits. Each player adds up the value of the wagons attached to the locomotive, then the obtained score is multiplied by the multiplier of the locomotive. This process is repeated for each of the locomotives. The earned money supplies the player's account. After three rounds, all the players add up their earned money. The player who earned the most, wins.&#10;&#10;Take a Train is an entertaining and exciting game, which gives everyone a chance to feel like a rail market tycoon.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34119/tales-arabian-nights" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Tales of the Arabian Nights</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Adventure, Arabian, Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Role Playing, Storytelling, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> From Z-Man Games Webpage:&#10;&#10;In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan!

Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10; Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10; Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10; Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other. The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best. An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/169652/turbo-rally-card-racing-thunder-track" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Thunder Track</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Racing</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Route/Network Building</div><div><b>Description:</b> THUNDER TRACK takes careful planning, patience, wit, and a healthy dose of foresight to become a champion.

When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only her first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154498/till-dawn" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Till Dawn</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.46</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2014</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 4 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Horror</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Press Your Luck, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Don't get caught in the sun!&#10;&#10; Till Dawn, a 20&ndash;30-minute game for 4-8 vampires (or 12, with the expansion), takes place over the course of three nights during which time all self respecting vampires leave their coffins to hunt.

In Titans of Industry, you must invest in building factories and businesses in order to produce goods and sell them to gain victory points (VPs). Game play involves a delicate balance of money, production, and goals. The person who can best manage his buildings and meet his goals in seven years will win.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with four workers and $6,000. Every turn, players first buy buildings, then place workers on those buildings or on the board. Factories allow you to produce goods, while Businesses allow you to sell those goods for money or VPs. A good player needs to balance production and sales, and encourage other players to sell with them to maximize sales. Board elements allow players to take advantage of bonuses, such as extra production, building improvements, and Corporate Strategy cards. Corporate Strategy cards help give players additional goals and direction, by specifying additional ways to gain victory points.&#10;&#10;Three times during the game &ndash; years 1923, 1925, and 1927 &ndash; upkeep will be due, and players must pay to maintain their buildings, or will need to take out loans. Players will need to sell enough goods before then to have enough money to cover the costs, as loans are worth negative victory points at the end of the game. After year 1927, whoever has the most victory points from combined sales, buildings, and Corporate Strategy cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Titans of Industry, which allows 3-6 players and plays in approximately 20-25 minutes per player, is a rich worker-placement/resource-management Euro-style game.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39206/click-clack-lumberjack" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Toc Toc Woodman</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.55</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2008</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 7</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Action / Dexterity, Children&#39;s Game</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b></div><div><b>Description:</b> There are two very different versions of Toc Toc Woodman, and also a third edition named Click Clack Lumberjack which makes minor additions to the second edition of Toc Toc Woodman.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124172/tsuro-seas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Tsuro of the Seas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.65</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 8</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 30 - 30</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Abstract Strategy, Nautical</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Player Elimination, Route/Network Building, Tile Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &mdash; that is, keep on the game board &mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104363/rex-final-days-empire" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Twilight Emperium: Rex Final Days of an Empire</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.19</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2012</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 120 - 120</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fighting, Negotiation, Political, Science Fiction</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Auction/Bidding, Hand Management, Partnerships, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&#10;&#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&#10;&#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&#10;&#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&#10;&#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Twilight Imperium: Third Edition</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.91</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2005</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 180 - 240</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Civilization, Negotiation, Political, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Wargame</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Area-Impulse, Dice Rolling, Hex-and-Counter, Modular Board, Trading, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from 'Puerto Rico' to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of 'Settlers of Catan', while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of 'Attack' to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10; Twilight Imperium (second edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10; Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire&#10; Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/134352/two-rooms-and-boom" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Two Rooms and a Boom</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 6 - 30</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 15 - 15</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Bluffing, Deduction, Negotiation, Party Game, Spies/Secret Agents</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Acting, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Two Rooms and a Boom &ndash; a social deduction/hidden role party game for six or more players &ndash; there are two teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.&#10;&#10;The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city. Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner. Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden? In Urbis you&rsquo;ll have to make decisions promptly.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="V"><div>V</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27042/veritas" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Veritas</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.85</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 3 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Medieval, Print &amp; Play</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Area Control / Area Influence, Pick-up and Deliver</div><div><b>Description:</b> Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Veritas is a Euro-style board game about the preservation of truth in Dark Ages France.

The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&#10;&#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&#10;&#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&#10;&#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&#10;&#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&#10;&#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.&#10;&#10;The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128621/viticulture" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Viticulture</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.87</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 90</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Economic, Farming</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards.

They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&#10;&#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136249/voodoo-mania" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Voodoo Mania</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.66</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2013</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 20 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Real-time</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Pattern Recognition</div><div><b>Description:</b> All players are ready for the big voodoo competition.

Who will be the first to use up all of his ingredients, and thus become the new voodoo master?&#10;&#10;In Voodoo Mania, each player starts with a hand of three cards and a reserve ingredient pile of 18-45 cards, depending on the number of players. One card starts in the center of the table. Each card is double-sided, and each side features four of five symbols on it (mask, amulet, voodoo doll, magic potion and top hat) in four of five colors.&#10;&#10;All players play at the same time, trying to play their cards in hand. To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says &quot;Voodoo!&quot; and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.&#10;&#10;At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile. Whenever a player plays a card, he draws a replacement card to keep three cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and everyone scores one point for each card still in hand or in the pile.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Watson &amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &#10;Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&ntilde;ar&aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&oacute;n de una serie de casos in&eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&oacute;n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber&aacute; sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra&iacute;das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l&oacute;gica deductiva.&#10;&#10;Y, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu&eacute;l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar&aacute; la confianza del genio de Baker Street.&#10;&#10;El juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu&aacute;les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar&aacute; de resolver antes que los dem&aacute;s.&#10;Para ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder&aacute;n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci&oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.&#10;Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes. Hecho esto, se devolver&aacute;n las cartas de pista a su lugar para que los dem&aacute;s puedan leerla en rondas posteriores.&#10;Este procedimiento se repetir&aacute; cada ronda, hasta que un jugador crea haber hallado la soluci&oacute;n al caso: en ese momento, habr&aacute; de dirigirse al 221B para comprobar si sus respuestas son acertadas.&#10;En caso de ser todas correctas, habr&aacute; ganado. En caso de error, habr&aacute; perdido y se retirar&aacute; de la partida.&#10;Cada detective contar&aacute;, adem&aacute;s, con la inestimable ayuda de una serie de aliados de Sherlock Holmes, as&iacute; como con la del propio detective y, sobre todo, la del buen Dr. Watson.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42448/we-didnt-playtest-either" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>We Didn&#39;t Playtest This Either</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.14</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2009</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 10</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 10</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Card Game, Humor</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Voting</div><div><b>Description:</b> From the box:&#10;&#10;Many will enter, some will win.

This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&#10;&#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.

The trick to doing this are the special blocks in the game: nine blocks &mdash; with three each in small, medium and large sizes &mdash; with three of the block sides being flat and three being curved. Set up the blocks in the right way, and you can block an opponent's path to victory.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181122/wrath-dragons" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Wrath of Dragons</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.55</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2015</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 90 - 0</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Fantasy</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection, Worker Placement</div><div><b>Description:</b> Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In Wrath of Dragons, each player assumes the role of a dragon that, over the course of many centuries, flies into different regions of the Old World to lay waste to settlements, scorch fields, snatch livestock, take gold, and capture nobles.&#10;&#10;After six centuries have passed, the devastation, destruction, and fear that the dragons have caused is scored, and the dragon that earns the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem" style="background-color:#fff" id="Y"><div>Y</div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71671/yggdrasil" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Yggdrasil</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 7.12</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2011</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 1 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 75 - 75</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Mythology</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Action Point Allowance System, Co-operative Play, Dice Rolling, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers</div><div><b>Description:</b> Yggdrasil is a co-operative game in which players are different gods of the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor, Tyr, Frey, Heimdall and Frejya.

Then the active player performs three different actions among the nine at his disposal in order to resist to the advance:&#10;&#10;&#10; Ask for the Elves' help&#10; Get a Weapon from the Dwarves&#10; Send the Valkyries looking for Vikings' souls on the mankind world Midgard&#10; Fight the Giants and try to gather the parts of a magic rune&#10; Negotiate with the Vanir&#10; Get rid of the Fire Giants who invade Midgard&#10; Get the Vikings back from Hel's world&#10; Exchange forces with another god&#10; Fight against the Enemies in Asgard&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player, depending on the god he plays, has a specific power that allows him to perform some actions better.

In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!&#10;&#10;The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They&rsquo;re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas.&#10;&#10;Prison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They&rsquo;re precious assets to any Zombicide team.&#10;&#10;Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. There&rsquo;s even an alternate ending.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62871/zombie-dice" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Zombie Dice</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 6.26</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2010</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 99</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 10 - 20</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Dice, Horror, Humor, Party Game, Zombies</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck</div><div><b>Description:</b> Eat brains. Don't get shotgunned.&#10;&#10;In Zombie Dice, you are a zombie. You want braaains &ndash; more brains than any of your zombie buddies. The 13 custom dice are your victims. Push your luck to eat their brains, but stop rolling before the shotgun blasts end your turn! Whoever collects 13 brains first wins. Each game takes 10 to 20 minutes and can be taught in a single round.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you take three dice from the box and roll them. A brain symbol is worth one point at the end of the round, while footsteps allow you to reroll this particular dice. Shotgun blasts on the other hand are rather bad, cause if you collect three shotgun blasts during your turn, it is over for you and you get no points. After rolling three dice, you may decide if you want to score your current brain collection or if you want to push your luck by grabbing new dice so you have three again and roll once more.&#10;&#10;</div></div></div><div class="gameitem"><div class="gameitemcontrols"><a style="" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2471/zombies" target="_blank">BGG</a></div><div class="gametitle"><span class="toggleDetails closed"></span>Zombies!!!</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Rating:</b> 5.92</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Year:</b> 2001</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:left;clear:both"><b>Players:</b> 2 - 6</div><div class="gamesummary" style="float:right"><b>Time:</b> 60 - 60</div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="gamesummary gamedetails"><div><b>Categories:</b> Exploration, Fighting, Horror, Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Zombies</div><div><b>Mechanics:</b> Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Roll / Spin and Move</div><div><b>Description:</b> Players take on the role of a survivor amid city streets sprawling with Zombies.
