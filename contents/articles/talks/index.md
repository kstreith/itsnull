I now have a dedicated section for [Talks](http://itsnull.com/talks/) at the top of the navigation. That has been updated to include my talks on ASP.NET Core this year. It also includes my talks from 2016, including Javascript Async Patterns, Behind the Scenes of A Modern Web App and Converting a Web App to ASP.NET Core.

Check out the slides and associated code, lots of good stuff there.
