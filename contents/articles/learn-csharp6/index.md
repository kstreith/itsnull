I'm presenting at Code Camp 2015. Pretty excited, it's my second year presenting. I'll be talking about the new C# features, along with some demos.

You can find my slides and demo code on-line:

* Slides: http://itsnull.com/presentations/csharp6/#/
* Sample Code: https://github.com/kstreith/csharp6

Feel free to use these presentations and code to get your team at work up to speed on C# 6.
