I've done 3 presentations for [TRINUG](http://www.trinug.org/) earlier in 2015. Now, I'll finally get around to posting links to those presentations. Better late then never...

* Debugging Javascript In The Browser
  * Slides: http://itsnull.com/presentations/debuggingjs/
  * Code: https://github.com/kstreith/js-debugging-samples This is broken JS code with hints on the page about what is broken. Useful for practicing your debugging skills.
* Diving Into Microsoft Open source
  * Slides: http://itsnull.com/presentations/diving-into-ms-opensource/
  * Code: Download the open-source Microsoft code (see slides for links) and read it, seriously reading source code is good for you.
* Learning JS Presentation
  * Slides: No slides for this. Presentation was about learning JS by reading existing open-source JS code
  * Code: https://github.com/kstreith/learning-js Repository has some sample pages using small javascript libraries along with guidance on how to start learning.

Hope these resources help.
