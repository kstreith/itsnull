I've done 3 presentations for [TRINUG](http://www.trinug.org/) earlier in 2015. Now, I'll finally get around to posting links to those presentations. Better late then never...

**Debugging Javascript In The Browser**
  * Slides: <a href="http://itsnull.com/presentations/debuggingjs/">View</a>
  * Code: <a href="https://github.com/kstreith/js-debugging-samples">On GitHub</a> This is broken JS code with hints on the page about what is broken. Useful for practicing your debugging skills.

**Diving Into Microsoft Open source**
  * Slides: <a href="http://itsnull.com/presentations/diving-into-ms-opensource/">View</a>
  * Code: Download the open-source Microsoft code (see slides for links) and read it, seriously reading source code is good for you.

**Learning JS Presentation**
  * Slides: No slides for this. Presentation was about learning JS by reading existing open-source JS code
  * Code: <a href="https://github.com/kstreith/learning-js">On GitHub</a> Repository has some sample pages using small javascript libraries along with guidance on how to start learning.

Hope these resources help.
