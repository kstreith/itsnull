I'm presenting [Raleigh .NET Conf Local 2017](https://www.meetup.com/TRINUG/events/242985614/) this weekend, October 28th, 2017.
 
I'm excited to be presenting on Developer Tools in the Web Browser. We will cover a bunch of content. Come learn how to use the developer tools for debugging and prototyping. But also how to use the dev tools to learn new web features and most importantly how to have empathy for your users and develop better web applications. It covers a wide variety of techniques, from beginners to experts.
