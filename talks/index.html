                <h2>Javascript Async Patterns</h2>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>This presentation covers patterns you can use for your asynchronous code in Javascript, specifically javascript in the browser. Covers callbacks and promises which you can use today. Touches on upcoming patterns like async/await keywords which may be added in a future version of Javascript. The goal is to come with away with some ideas about how to improve your async code and the pros/cons of the various patterns.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Part 4 of a 4 part series. The purpose of the series is to build up a sample web application.
                    The application being built is a Chore tracking application, tracking children, chores assigned to children and whether a child has completed a chore.
                    The final session discusses and shows solutions to problems raised in earlier sessions.
                    This session also covers writing client-side validation, both using a two-way data binding framework and as a separate client-side validation library.
                    This session wraps up all the previous sessions to end up with a final usable chore tracking application.
                    The goal of this series is to intentionally NOT use a framework and write the code by hand to better learn how frameworks work.

                    The application being built is a Chore tracking application, tracking children, chores assigned to children and whether a child has completed a chore.
                    In this third part, separating each grid into it's own component is discussed.
                    This sample discusses bugs that can occur with slow responding servers and possible ways to mitigate these bugs.
                    The web application silently fails if there are server side errors and methods to deal with server side errors are discussed.
                    Finally, a simple two-way data binding framework is provided and discussed so that users have some understanding how frameworks work.
                    The goal of this series is to intentionally NOT use a framework and write the code by hand to better learn how frameworks work.

                    In this second part, a fully functional back-end has been written in ASP.Net MVC4 and as such Visual Studio 2013 or later is required to run the app.
                    The front-end does not use MVC and uses static HTML and plain javascript.
                    In this session, attaching event handlers, directly and with event delegation is discussed along with how to create modal dialogs in HTML.
                    The goal of this series is to intentionally NOT use a framework and write the code by hand to better learn how frameworks work.

                    The application being built is a Chore tracking application, tracking children, chores assigned to children and whether a child has completed a chore.
                    In this first part, the goal is simply to write code that renders each of the three grids.
                    The examples show creating DOM elements with JQuery, without JQuery, mitigating cross-site scripting attacks and ways to improve rendering performance.
                    Finally, a small templating library is shown to demonstrate how a templating library might be written.
                    The goal of this series is to intentionally NOT use a framework and write the code by hand to better learn how frameworks work.
